r research funding for instrumental developments. In this way the necessity for supporting local ion beams facilities will become obvious to national funding bodies. Improvement of the technical performance of the infrastructures. Conducting targeted Joint Research Activities on the methodology and techniques will result in further improvements and capabilities of the TNA. Provision of User Access: The objective is to deliver at least 13500 hours of access to users over the 54 months of the SPIRIT project through around 200 users and 229 user projects.
