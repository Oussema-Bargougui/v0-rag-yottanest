advances in Radiation oncology especially in RT. Radiation therapy comes in various forms. The two main categories of RT are External Beam RT (EBRT) and internal RT or also known as brachytherapy. EBRT has photon based and proton-based treatment techniques. Photon beam Radiotherapy is generally employed to provide radiation treatment across the globe. However, the demand and usage of Particle beam therapy is increasing worldwide despite its higher cost compared to conventional linear accelerator (LINAC) based Photon Radiation Therapy.
