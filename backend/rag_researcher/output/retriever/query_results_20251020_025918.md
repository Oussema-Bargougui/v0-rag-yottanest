ular for new interdisciplinary investigations such as for chemical surface analysis (a report on Chemical Imaging Techniques with Accelerated Ion Beams has been published), environmental studies, radiation biology, and forensics. This has also enhanced the quality of the transnational use during the project, and ensures the general availability of cutting-edge ion technologies in Europe. Both Transnational Access and Joint Research activities have clearly demonstrated the potential of ion technologies in new and emerging fields as well as in areas of high socio-economic relevance.
