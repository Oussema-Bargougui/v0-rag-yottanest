industry in Transnational Access has been small. The latter can be attributed to the fact that the rules and procedures involved in EU infrastructure programs are less compatible with industrial practices, as with respect to IPR and non-disclosure issues, the time delay due to the proposal evaluation process, and the request for trans-nationality. Thus, industry generally prefers cooperation and services on a bilateral contract base.
