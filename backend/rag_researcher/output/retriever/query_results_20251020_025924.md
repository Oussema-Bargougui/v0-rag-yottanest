a segment traditionally considered unprofitable. In 2013, DNB launched a bold SME strategy, deliberately choosing a gross approach to win new startups early in their life cycle rather than a net approach focused on the profitability of existing accounts. This strategy, enabled by a significant investment in digitalization and a cultural shift toward customer lifecycle engagement, generated exceptional results and by 2025, the SME segment delivered the highest return on allocated capital. The journey, however, was not linear.

ues by segment for FY 2021 are not available yet. Hitachi does not provide Revenues for Proton therapy separately and therefore direct comparison of PT revenue with other companies is not possible. Proton Therapy falls under Smart life segment. Within Smart life segment is diagnostic imaging & therapy sub segment which includes Particle Therapy system. In 2020 diagnostic imaging & Therapy sub segment reported USD 1.64 bn. Hitachi mean, median, maximum and minimum revenues are $ 82.31, $ 81.99, $ 88.1, $ 77.9 bn over past 6 years from 2021-2016.
