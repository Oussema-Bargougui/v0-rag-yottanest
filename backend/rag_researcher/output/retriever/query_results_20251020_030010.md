employees**: Results are shown in Table XIII XIV. Siemens Healthineers clearly has stated in its annual reports [8, 28, 29] total number of Employees in R&D. However other 4 companies have mostly failed to state number of employees in R&D. From the data available it seems Siemens Healthineer has highest number of employees in R&D i.e. over 10,000 in 2021, about 10,000 in 2020 and about 9000 in 2019. This translates very well in production of huge number of AI based applications and products. Hitachi has second highest number of R&D staff at the end of FY 2019 i.e. 2650.

ber of R&D staff at the end of FY 2019 i.e. 2650. This may be the reason Hitachi has managed to produce highest number of innovations per year. IBA had 200 Engineers and experts in R&D in 2019. IBA R&D staff has managed to produce about 33 innovations from 2022 to 2018 which is very good performance. No data is available regarding Accuray R&D staff. As far as total number of employees are concerned it seems Hitachi has the highest number of Employees i.e. 350864. Siemens Healthineers have 51,000 total number of employees in 2021.
