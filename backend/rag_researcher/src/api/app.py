FastAPI Application Module
===========================

This module creates and configures FastAPI application instance.

WHAT IS FASTAPI?
----------------
FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.
Key features:
1. Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go
2. Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn
3. Automatic Docs: Generates interactive API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
4. Type Hints: Uses Python type hints for validation and documentation
5. Async Support: Built-in support for async/await

WHY A SEPARATE APP MODULE?
--------------------------
Separating app creation from entry point (main.py) allows us to:
1. Import app in different contexts (testing, workers, etc.)
2. Configure app in one place
3. Keep entry point clean and simple
4. Avoid circular imports

APPLICATION FACTORY PATTERN:
---------------------------
We use a function (create_app) to create FastAPI instance.
This pattern provides:
1. Flexibility: Can create apps with different configurations
2. Testing: Easy to create test instances with mock dependencies
3. Clarity: All app setup logic is in one function

# =============================================================================
# APPLICATION LIFESPAN (STARTUP/SHUTDOWN EVENTS)
# =============================================================================
# We use a lifespan context manager to initialize shared providers at startup.
# This ensures that:
# 1. All providers (embedding, vector store, LLM) are initialized ONCE
# 2. Both ingestion and query routes use SAME provider instances
# 3. The application is fully ready before accepting requests
#
# WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?
# ----------------------
# Previously, providers were created separately by each service:
# - IngestionService created its own vector store
# - RAGPipeline created its own vector store
# - Documents uploaded via ingestion were stored in one store
# - Queries searched a different store → documents not found!
#
# Now with shared providers:
# - Both use SAME vector store (initialized here at startup)
# - Uploaded documents are correctly found by queries

    This runs at startup and shutdown:
    - Startup: Initialize shared providers (embedding, vector store, LLM)
    - Shutdown: Clean up resources (if needed)

    WHY INITIALIZE AT STARTUP?
    --------------------------
    1. Fail fast: If a provider can't be initialized, we know immediately
    2. Warm up: First request doesn't have initialization delay
    3. Consistency: All services use the same initialized providers

        ## Production-Grade RAG Engine

        This API provides Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities
        for building intelligent question-answering systems.

        ### Features

        * **Query Endpoint**: Ask questions and get AI-generated answers
        * **Source Citations**: Answers include references to source documents
        * **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for production workloads

        ### Current Status

        **Step 1**: Minimal API skeleton with mocked responses.

        Future steps will add:
        - Real vector database integration
        - Embedding model support
        - LLM integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
        - Document ingestion pipeline

    # STEP 2: Configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
    # =========================================================================
    # CORS controls which websites can call our API from a browser.
    # Without proper CORS settings, browsers will block requests from
    # web applications hosted on different domains.

    # For development, we allow all origins (*).
    # In production, you should restrict this to your frontend domains.

    # STEP 3: Include Route Handlers
    # =========================================================================
    # We include each router which registers its endpoints with the app.
    # The prefix from the router is used, so query routes become /query/*
