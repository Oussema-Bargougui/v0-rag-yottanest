      "text": "ABOUT THE POLLEN STREET BUSINESS Pollen Street Group Limited (the “Company” and together with its subsidiaries the “Group” or “Pollen Street”) is an alternative asset manager dedicated to investing within the financial and business services sectors across both Private Equity and Private Credit strategies. The business was founded in 2013 and has consistently delivered top tier returns alongside growing assets under management (“AuM”).\nPollen Street benefits from a complementary set of asset management activities focused on managing third-party AuM (the “Asset Manager”) together with on-balance sheet investments (the “Investment Company”).\nThe Asset Manager raises capital from top tier investors and deploys it into its Private Equity and Private Credit strategies. The strong recurring revenues from this business enable us to deliver scalable growth.\nThe Investment Company invests in the strategies of the Group delivering attractive risk adjusted returns aligned with our Limited Partner investors. The portfolio consists of both direct investments and investments in Private Equity and Private Credit funds managed by Pollen Street.\nFurther information on the Pollen Street business can be found on the Group’s website.\nBACKGROUND & BASIS OF PREPARATION Pollen Street Group Limited was established on 24 December 2021, in Guernsey. On 24 January 2024, the Company became the immediate and ultimate parent of Pollen Street Limited (previously Pollen Street plc) by way of a scheme of arrangement pursuant to Part 26 of the UK Companies Act 2006 (the “Scheme”). On 14 February 2024, Pollen Street Limited distributed the entire issued share capital of Pollen Street Capital Holdings Limited to the Company, this is referred to as the “Distribution”.\nThe Scheme and the Distribution are together referred to as the “Reorganisation”. The Reorganisation is a capital reorganisation and has been accounted for using the book-value method. This method applies retrospectively, meaning that the Annual Report and Accounts are restated as if the Reorganisation had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented, i.e. from 1 January 2023. Further information on the Reorganisation is provided in Note 4 to the Financial Statements.\nThe prior year comparatives are unaudited for Pollen Street Group Limited. They are based on the audited consolidated financial statements for Pollen Street Limited as set out in the Pollen Street Limited Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2023 and the audited Pollen Street Group Limited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 as set out in the Pollen Street Group Limited Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2023.\nPOLLEN STREET AT A GLANCE POLLEN STREET 5 Strategic Report 5",

      "text": "As Chairman of Pollen Street Group Limited, I am pleased to report on another year of significant progress and accomplishment in 2024. The Group has delivered strong performance across all key metrics while advancing our strategic objectives.\nA PIVOTAL YEAR OF EXCEPTIONAL DELIVERY Our 2024 performance reflects the successful execution of our strategy with consistent delivery of strong returns through a clear and repeatable investment strategy and achievement of successful fundraises across both Private Equity and Private Credit. By attracting new investors and deepening relationships with existing investors, we have grown total AuM to £5.4 billion in December 2024, a 29 per cent increase from £4.2 billion at the end of 2023.\nIn 2024, we increased AuM across both Private Equity and Private Credit. Private Equity AuM grew to £3.5 billion - a 32 per cent increase on prior year driven by strong investor support for Private Equity Fund V as well as co-investment offered to our Limited Partners (“LPs”). Private Credit AuM grew to £1.9 billion - a 24 per cent increase, with capital raised in Private Credit Fund IV and associated separately managed accounts.\nThe Investment Company maintained its track record of stable and predictable returns, with income on Net Investment Assets growing to £31.8 million (2023: £30.2 million), representing a return on Net Investment Assets of 9.6 per cent (2023: 8.8 per cent) for the year ended 31 December 2024. This growth enabled the Group to return £48 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks during the year.\nThe private capital sector continues to benefit from favourable macro tailwinds, including increasing institutional allocation to private markets and sustained demand especially in the mid-market.\nWe expect further acceleration in this trend, which as a focused financial and business services specialist with a proven investment strategy, we are wellpositioned to capitalise on.\nRobert Sharpe Chair CHAIR’S STATEMENT Our financial performance has been robust, with Operating Profit showing substantial growth underpinned by strong AuM growth and operational leverage. The Investment Company continues to be a key asset, driving third party AuM growth while maintaining robust income generation and growing capital invested through Pollen Street managed funds.\nCAPITAL ALLOCATION FRAMEWORK & BUYBACK PROGRAMME Reflecting our strategic and operational development, and following its conversion from an investment trust to a commercial company, the Group put in place an enhanced capital allocation framework in March 2024. This framework prioritises strategic growth in our funds and other organic growth opportunities, while also providing confidence in additional cash returns to shareholders which were value accretive.\nThrough 2024, we have demonstrated disciplined adherence to the framework.\nWe have committed £196 million to Pollen Street funds as well as making cash returns to shareholders of £48 million. The Board has declared a second interim dividend of 27.1 pence per share, bringing the total dividend for the year to 53.6 pence per share or £33 million.\nPOLLEN STREET 8 Annual Report and Accounts 2024\n\n[IMAGE]\nCaption: Image extracted from document",

      "text": "POLLEN STREET 9 Strategic Report CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND ESG REPORTING The implementation of the final stages of the reorganisation of the Group following the combination of Pollen Street Capital Holdings Limited with Pollen Street Limited (formerly Honeycomb Investment Trust Plc) was a key focus for the start of the year. This included the transition from an Investment Trust to a Commercial Company.\nStrong governance is core to how we are building better, more sustainable businesses. Through our systematic data-driven approach to environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”), we’ve helped portfolio companies and borrowers develop robust policies and procedures, supporting sustainable growth and operational excellence, as well as driving progress in the social and environmental spheres.\nThe expansion of ESG margin ratchets from 8 to 16 credit facilities demonstrates Pollen Street’s commitment to incentivising positive change.\nThe Group continues to strengthen its approach to reporting and climate risk management, ensuring transparency and accountability across its investments, considering the evolving ESG regulatory environment.\nAs I noted in the Annual General Meeting in June 2024, I have now reached my nine-year tenure as a Director of the Group. A search is underway for a new Chair with several strong candidates identified and interviewed. Once the new Chair has been identified the intention is for there to be a period of three months handover to ensure a smooth transition.\nI am pleased to welcome Crispin Goldsmith who joined the leadership team as Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) in January 2025. Crispin’s experience across both private and public markets brings a unique blend of skills to our financial leadership.\nLOOKING FORWARD OUTLOOK: POLLEN STREET’S GROWTH TRAJECTORY The last year has been pivotal for the Pollen Street Group, characterised by substantial AuM growth, supported by the success of Private Equity Fund V and Private Credit Fund IV. Our fundraising achievements have affirmed our competitive edge and specialised strategic focus, and our recent inclusion in the FTSE 250 in January 2025 was a significant corporate milestone.\nAs we progress through 2025, whilst mindful of an increasingly uncertain global environment, our outlook remains positive. The private markets landscape continues to present growth opportunities, with our specialist focus positioning us strongly. We are actively expanding our investor relationships, further driving AuM growth, while maintaining strong Investment Company returns, notwithstanding any share buyback activities.\nThe Board and I extend our gratitude to the entire Pollen Street team for their exceptional execution. We look forward to delivering further success in 2025, thanks to the continued support of our limited partner investors, shareholders and employees.\nRobert Sharpe Chair 24 March 2025",

      "text": "I am pleased to report another year of strong performance for Pollen Street, marked by exceptional investment and fundraising execution and strategic growth. Our AuM saw a significant increase, across both Private Equity and Private Credit strategies demonstrating the strength and resilience of the business. Private Equity AuM growth was driven by the success of our Private Equity Fund V as well as strong co-investment initiatives. Private Equity V has surpassed its target of €1 billion with further capital commitments anticipated in 2025. Similarly, Private Credit experienced a strong year of fundraising and deployment. This is continuing well during 2025. Our focus on financial and business services, coupled with our long track record of performance, continues to set us apart in the competitive alternative asset management landscape.\nDELIVERING STRONG PERFORMANCE This year’s success is reflected in strong growth of fund management revenue and earnings. The Group’s Operating Profit grew to £58.2 million for 2024, up from £44.5 million in 2023. The primary growth driver was our Asset Manager, with Operating Profit increasing to £27.2 million (47 per cent of Group), from £15.9 million (36 per cent of Group) in 2023. This growth underscores our robust operational framework, well-invested platform and strategic market positioning. It highlights the operational leverage inherent in our business model, allowing us to scale revenues while maintaining costs efficiently.\nWELL-POSITIONED STRATEGY Our investment strategies, leveraging both Private Equity and Private Credit capabilities, have proven resilient in the current turbulent market environment.\nOur ability to deliver consistent, high-quality returns, within an attractive risk framework, positions us strongly for sustainable, long-term growth. The strength of our balance sheet remains a crucial Lindsey McMurray Chief Executive Officer CEO REPORT differentiator and enables us to align ourselves with our LPs. With £196 million in General Partner (“GP”) commitments to Pollen Street managed funds, we are well positioned to attract new investors, deepen existing relationships and pursue selective inorganic growth opportunities.\nASSET MANAGER Private Equity Our Private Equity strategy focuses on backing mid‑market companies in the financial and business services sector, typically taking majority stakes in European-headquartered businesses. We partner with talented leadership teams, often founder-led, to accelerate growth by applying deep sector expertise and a proven operational framework.\nOur approach, which has been refined and tested through multiple market cycles, targets companies with an excellent customer proposition that are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities as the industry continues to undergo structural changes. This strength has persisted well in 2024 and 2025 through macro‑economic and political volatility. The Financial Services sector, our core specialism, continues to experience change and disruption through technology transformation and adoption, industry consolidation and evolving regulatory oversight. We remain strategically well placed to navigate and capitalise on opportunities.\nPOLLEN STREET 10 Annual Report and Accounts 2024\n\n[IMAGE]\nCaption: Image extracted from document",

      "text": "11 Private Credit Our Private Credit strategy focuses on providing predominantly senior secured, asset-based lending to mid-market companies across Europe. We target non-bank lenders, leasing businesses, technology companies, and other entities with diverse portfolios of financial or hard assets. This approach allows us to fill the funding gap created by the retrenchment of banks from lending markets following the global financial crisis, a trend that has continued to accelerate in recent years.\nThrough 2024, the private credit market continued to provide strong conditions for growth with higher interest rates and ongoing borrowing demand from the SME community. Our reliable and consistent approach and growing reputation has ensured that we remain an attractive destination for borrowers and that we continue to deliver returns uncorrelated to other private credit strategies.\nFundraising and Deployment Total AuM was at £5.4 billion as of 31 December 2024, up 29 per cent from £4.2 billion at the end of 2023. Our journey over the last year has been marked by significant milestones, particularly in our fundraising for Private Equity Fund V, which now has €1.1 billion in commitments, exceeding our €1 billion target. Given strong investor appetite, we are continuing fundraising into 2025 with the final close now expected in mid-2025. Along with Private Equity Fund V, we have raised over £400 million of funds in Co-Invest vehicles. Whilst these are non-fee-paying, this further supports the development of long-term strategic relationships with our investors. In Private Credit, we raised over £500 million in Credit funds in 2024, completing the first close of Private Credit Fund IV and a new UK Separate Managed Account (“SMA”). Fundraising for Private Credit Fund IV has strong momentum and is on track to meet the target of £1 billion in 2025. At December 2024, we had in excess of £500 million of available capital in our Credit funds which will convert to fee-paying AuM once deployed.\n2024 was also a strong year for deployment.\nWe invested £1.1 billion in Private Equity and £0.6 billion in Private Credit. We have a rich pipeline of opportunities in both strategies and look forward to another strong year for deployments in 2025.\nClient Base The strength of our investor relationships has been central to our fundraising progress. Our LP investor base continues to be the cornerstone of our success.\nWe have nurtured strong relationships with existing investors while expanding our geographical reach.\nMany of our new investors are the result of several years of dedicated relationship building.\nThe fundraise during the year across the strategies has been instrumental in deepening our penetration into the deep capital pools in Europe, North America and the Middle East. Our strategic approach has diversified our investor base, tapping into new markets and reflecting the investments we have made in business development capabilities within the team. As we move forward, we remain dedicated to nurturing these relationships with continued outstanding performance to ensure that Pollen Street is strategically positioned for sustained long-term growth.\nINVESTMENT COMPANY Our balance sheet continues to be a highly valuable strategic asset enabling the acceleration of Third-Party AuM growth as we demonstrate strong alignment with our LPs. The ability for the manager to make significant GP commitments, c.2 - 5 per cent in Private Equity Funds and 7 - 10 per cent in Private Credit Funds, supports in attracting new investors and in growing relationships with existing ones.\nThe Investment Company has committed £196 million to Pollen Street managed funds, with 66 per cent drawn (2023: 29 per cent). As of the end of 2024, the balance sheet allocation was 91 per cent Private Credit and 9 per cent Private Equity. Our balance sheet investments have performed well, delivering robust Investment Company returns and, notwithstanding share buybacks of £23 million on top of dividends paid of £25 million, the Investment Company delivered strong income generation of £31.8 million.\nSuccess Indicators I am delighted to report that we have excelled across all the success indicators outlined in our half-year 2024 results presentation.\nPOLLEN STREET 11 Strategic Report",

Our focus remains on delivering exceptional returns to our investors and shareholders with our key priorities for 2025:\n•\t Complete fundraising of Private Equity Fund V to final close ahead of target •\t Complete fundraising of Private Credit Fund IV, targeting £1 billion and maintain deployment •\t Expand AuM towards our medium term target of £10 billion •\t Maintain our progressive dividend policy while strategically deploying capital for shareholder value •\t Return surplus capital to shareholders through share buybacks, subject to relative attractiveness compared to other value‑creation opportunities The medium-term growth prospects for private markets remain strong, and we are confident in our long-term goal of reaching a Total AuM of £10 billion, notwithstanding an increasingly uncertain global landscape.\nIn closing, I would like to extend my gratitude to our amazing team whose hard work and commitment have been instrumental in achieving these results.\nI also want to thank our limited partners, shareholders and wider group of counterparties for their continued trust and support.\nI would specifically like to thank Robert Sharpe, our Chairman, who will be retiring from the Board this year. Robert has been an exceptional leader of the Board and the Group as it has transitioned from an investment trust to our current business. He leaves us with a very strong strategic position and we are extremely grateful.\nLindsey McMurray Chief Executive Officer 24 March 2025 POLLEN STREET 12 Annual Report and Accounts 2024",

The Private Equity strategy continues to attract new investors and deepen the relationship with existing ones. The success of the fundraising of Private Equity Fund V is a reflection of the confidence that investors draw from Pollen Street’s track record of top-tier returns, the pace of growth the investment team has demonstrated is achievable across the portfolio and the depth of pipeline of attractive deals into which the fund will be invested.\nMichael England Partner 24 March 2025 POLLEN STREET 15 Strategic Report",

      "text": "Matthew Potter Partner Pollen Street’s Private Credit strategy is focused on asset-based lending (“ABL”) to mid-market companies across Europe. The Group earns management fees, performance fees and carried interest from managing and advising funds investing in this strategy. This section gives insight into the strategy and its performance in 2024.\nAsset-based lending is the funding behind the everyday credit that powers our economy and society.\nWe provide funding to support everything from building homes, to funding SMEs, to vehicle financing.\nWe do this by providing predominantly senior secured loans to companies that are serving these end markets secured on diverse portfolios of cash flow generating assets, such as loans, leases and vehicles, alongside corporate guarantees.\nFollowing the global financial crisis, and the subsequent retrenchment of the banks from lending markets, Pollen Street identified opportunities to fill the funding gap in what is a large and growing market. This is a trend that has continued to accelerate further in recent years. Our asset-backed lending strategy aims to deliver returns uncorrelated to other private credit strategies with a through-the‑cycle approach designed to withstand significant stress. Direct asset‑backing combined with seniority, comprehensive covenants and bespoke structuring delivers significant downside protection and alignment with asset originators and servicers. Pollen Street has a proven ability to access a hard-to-reach market through our dedicated team, meaning we are able to consistently generate premium returns versus other private and public debt strategies.\nPRIVATE CREDIT STRATEGY We are experts in this large market, with a deep network of long-term established relationships and experience that allows us to identify opportunities and target a fragmented and underpenetrated part of the market.\nOur team focuses on the mid-market where we believe the greatest opportunity and largest financing gap exists meaning we can create the most favourable risk-reward profile. This has increasingly led to Pollen Street having a reputation as the “go-to” provider in the market.\nWe also believe in the positive economic impact our asset-backed financing can deliver. The facilities we provide fund the real economy and can deliver economic growth and job creation, facilitate the building of new homes and finance the energy transition.\nHOW IT WORKS: STRUCTURING FOR PROTECTION The investment strategy seeks to combine the benefits of the asset-backed and corporate lending markets following a tested and structured investment approach that has delivered consistently strong returns and low volatility. Significant credit protection is created through both asset security and transaction structuring with senior loans secured directly against large and diverse pools of the assets which generate the revenue and POLLEN STREET 16 Annual Report and Accounts 2024\n\n[IMAGE]\nCaption: Image extracted from document",

The portfolio is performing well and has already delivered a number of realisations with realised returns ahead of underwritten expectations.\nPrivate Credit Fund IV deployment has started at pace, now benefiting from a well-seeded portfolio with 11 investments closed. Return performance has been strong and by sourcing a deep pipeline we have been able to be highly selective and have built strong diversification across asset classes in both the UK and Europe.\nFurther, we were pleased to achieve a Fund Rating of “A” for Private Credit Fund IV, based on our investment approach and the strategy we deploy consistently across both Private Credit Fund III and Private Credit Fund IV. We believe this highlights the quality of our approach.\nThroughout 2024 debt markets remained buoyant with high volumes of primary issuance across public and private markets. This environment saw spreads reduce particularly across broadly syndicated and heavily intermediated markets where barriers to entry for capital are low and markets are highly efficient.\nIn the asset-based lending sector we saw a similar increase in activity with borrowers looking to take advantage of the current environment to secure debt facilities to enable them to grow their businesses.\nReturns and margins are more resilient in mid-market ABL, as market inefficiencies and the bi-lateral nature of transactions create greater barriers to entry, meaning we are able to secure better lender terms and protections. Our pipeline is at record levels with net unlevered Internal Rate of Returns (“IRRs”) still typically 11 per cent to 13 per cent, with a good balance between asset classes, including our key investment areas of SME, real estate and government backed receivables.\nMatthew Potter Partner 24 March 2025 POLLEN STREET 17 Strategic Report",

      "text": "Crispin Goldsmith Chief Financial Officer DELIVERING STRONG PERFORMANCE I am pleased to present Pollen Street’s financial results for 2024. It has been a successful year, with strong growth in our financial performance from excellent fundraising outcomes and continued robust fund performance marking progress towards our mediumterm targets. This has driven an increase in Fee-Paying AuM of £0.6 billion, or 17 per cent, on the prior year which has in turn generated higher management fees and allowed the Group to deliver profits for 2024 which are ahead of expectations. The Investment Company delivered performance in line with expectations despite the declining interest rate environment and the completion of £22.9 million of share buybacks which had the effect of reducing invested assets.\nFundraising across both strategies brings total AuM to £5.4 billion as at 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023: £4.2 billion). Fundraising for Private Equity Fund V has been strong, as we continue to develop new relationships with investors and deepen existing ones, and is already ahead of our €1 billion target. We expect to complete the fundraising of this fund during 2025, with an additional £0.2 billion already closed in early 2025. In addition to the fundraising activity for Private Equity Fund V, we have also raised £0.4 billion of co‑invest funds to invest alongside our flagship funds.\nFundraising for Private Credit Fund IV has strong momentum as we capitalise on our leading position in the asset-backed market. We are on track to raise the target £1 billion in total commitments during 2025, with £0.1 billion closed in early 2025.\nDeployment of the new funds was active with 15 new deals and £238 million commitments invested; the business has a large pipeline of attractive new deals to continue this deployment into 2025.\nCFO REPORT The Operating Profit for the Group increased by 31 per cent to £58.2 million (2023: £44.5 million).\nThe main driver of this material increase was the 71 per cent increase in the Operating Profit of the Asset Manager segment to £27.2 million (2023: £15.9 million) as successful fundraising grew revenue, while the business benefitted from its inherent operational gearing. There was a £1.6 million increase in Operating Profit of the Investment Company, reflecting the positive effect of the transition into Pollen Street managed funds and the benefit of redeploying realised Credit Assets into a higher interest rate environment.\nThe Investment Asset portfolio delivered another period of strong and consistent performance with Income on Net Investment Assets of £31.8 million (2023: £30.2 million). In particular, the portfolio generated a strong level of cash of £239 million (2023: £184 million), driven by a high level of realisations and demonstrating the quality and liquidity of the assets.\nIn accordance with our strategy, investments from the Investment Company into Pollen Street managed funds have increased with £196 million currently committed, up from £93 million at December 2023.\nThese commitments are typically drawn over several years. At 31 December 2024, £130 million had been drawn (2023: £57 million).\nPOLLEN STREET 18 Annual Report and Accounts 2024\n\n[IMAGE]\nCaption: Image extracted from document",

      "text": "GROWING ASSET MANAGER EARNINGS Assets under management are tracked on a total and fee-paying basis. Total AuM tracks the commitments that investors have made into funds managed by the Asset Manager, whereas Fee-Paying AuM tracks the basis on which the Group earns management fees. For Private Equity, the Fee-Paying AuM is the committed capital in the flagship funds, changing to invested capital at the earlier of five years from first close or when the subsequent flagship fund holds its first close. Co-investment vehicles are typically non-fee paying. Fee-Paying AuM for Private Credit is the net invested amount. So non-Fee-Paying AuM for Private Credit will become fee-paying as it is deployed. See page 199 for full definitions. Total AuM was £5.4 billion as at 31 December 2024 (2023:\n£4.2 billion).\nTotal AuM 2024 (£ billion) 2023 (£ billion) Private Equity 3.5 2.6 Credit 1.9 1.6 Total 5.4 4.2 Fee-Paying AuM 2024 (£ billion) 2023 (£ billion) Private Equity 2.6 2.0 Credit 1.4 1.4 Total 4.0 3.4 Fundraising has increased Private Equity Fee‑Paying AuM to £2.6 billion (2023: £2.0 billion), with Fee‑Paying AuM for the Private Credit strategy at £1.4 billion (2023: £1.4 billion). The Private Credit strategy has seen the amortisation of several SMAs following underlying loan repayments offset by growth in deployment for its new funds. Combined, this represents a growth rate of 17 per cent in Fee-Paying AuM for the year. We expect Fee-Paying AuM for the Private Credit strategy to increase going forward as the newly raised funds in Private Credit Fund IV are deployed and convert into Fee-Paying AuM.\nFund Management Income comprises management fees, performance fees and income from carried interest. Revenue growth has been driven by increases in the Group’s Fee-Paying AuM and the beneficial impact of catch-up fees, as outlined below.\nTotal Income increased by 36 per cent to £66.8 million (2023: £49.2 million).\nAs a result of continuing Private Equity fundraising and Private Credit deployment, Fee-Paying AuM has now increased to £4.3 billion.\nFund Management Administration Costs increased at a lower rate of 19 per cent to £39.6 million (2023:\n£33.3 million). This moderate increase reflects a wellinvested cost base, leading to a flow through from incremental revenue to profitability. The cost increase has been driven by a combination of promotions and pay rises within the team and with a slight increase in headcount. As a result, Operating Profit in the Asset Manager segment increased by 71 per cent to £27.2 million (2023: £15.9 million).\nThe Group tracks the performance of this segment using Fund Management EBITDA, which is the Operating Profit less the accounting cost of the office lease2, which was a £1.5 million charge for 2024 (2023: £1.0 million) driven by a rent review increase. Fund Management EBITDA has grown by 72 per cent to £25.7 million (2023: £14.9 million), while Fund Management EBITDA Margin has grown from 30 per cent to 39 per cent over the year, reflecting the inherent operational leverage in the Asset Manager.\n2\t The accounting cost of the office lease is defined as the depreciation of the lease asset.\nPOLLEN STREET 19 Strategic Report",

Investors who join these funds after the first investors’ admission date are charged catch‑up fees, so all investors pay fees from the date of the first close. In general, Private Credit funds charge fees on net invested capital. Capital is generally recycled until the end of the investment period. Management fee rates remain the same for the duration of the funds.\nWe have guided to a long-term management fee rate blended across the Private Equity and Private Credit strategies of between 1.25 per cent and 1.5 per cent and are at the upper end of this guidance in 2024 at 1.50 per cent (2023: 1.16 per cent) in part due to the catch‑up fees charged on the funds raised in Private Equity Fund V in the year. Excluding the £5.9 million of catch-up management fees charged, the Management Fee Rate for 2024 would have been 1.34 per cent.\nIn addition to management fees, the Group earns performance fees and carried interest. These allow the Group to share in the profits of the funds under management and are variable amounts dependent on the level of fund returns. The entitlement to carried interest and the amount, is determined by the level of accumulated profits exceeding an agreed threshold (the “hurdle”) over the lifetime of each fund. The Group earns 25 per cent of the carried interest in all funds since Fund IV in Private Equity and Fund III in Private Credit.\nCarried interest is generally 20 per cent of the Private Equity fund returns over a hurdle of 8 per cent per annum with full catch-up. Carried interest for the Private Credit funds is generally 10 per cent of returns with a 5 to 6 per cent hurdle and full catch-up. Performance fees and carried interest recognised in 2024 reflect the continued growth in the value of the fund portfolios and represents 17 per cent of Fund Management Income for the year (2023: 30 per cent) and 7 per cent of total income for the year (2023: 11 per cent). This is at the lower end of the long-term guidance of 15 per cent to 25 per cent of Fund Management Income, reflecting outperformance in management fees together with stable performance fee and carry valuation growth.\nPOLLEN STREET 20 Annual Report and Accounts 2024",

      "text": "As part of the combination of Pollen Street Capital Holdings Limited with Pollen Street Limited (formerly Honeycomb Investment Trust Plc) completed on 30 September 2022 (the “Combination”), the group purchased 25 per cent of the carried interest rights in two of the Private Equity Funds. These are recognised under IFRS 9 and represent 90 per cent of the recognised carried interest to date. The remaining carried interest owned by the Group is accounted for under IFRS 15 and income is only recognised to the extent it is highly probable that there would not be a significant reversal of any accumulated income recognised on the completion of a fund. The reversal risk due to uncertainty of future fund performance is managed through the application of discounts. The discount applied for each fund depends on the stage and maturity profile of each fund and therefore recognises the de-risking of the income over time, taking into account diversity of assets, whether there has been a recent market correction (and whether this has already been factored into the valuation of the fund) and the expected average remaining holding period. Under IFRS 15, if no discount rate was applied to the carried interest outstanding the carried interest receivable would increase by £13.1 million (2023:\n£5.2 million).\nCONSISTENT INVESTMENT COMPANY RETURNS The Investment Company delivered strong returns in the period with Return on Net Investment Assets increasing to 9.6 per cent and Income on Net Investment Assets of £31.8 million, in line with expectations despite £22.9 million of share buybacks, which had the effect of reducing invested assets. We have maintained our disciplined approach resulting in robust performance which is well diversified across deals and borrowers and the performance of Pollen Street managed funds.\nThe largest investment accounted for 10.1 per cent of the portfolio, with the portfolio being 80 per cent invested in Credit Assets and 20 per cent invested in Private Equity Assets (either in direct deals or through Pollen Street managed funds). The portfolio has seen high levels of cash generation in the year of £239 million (2023: £184 million) driven by realisations and strong cash generation from interest payments and amortisations on continuing positions. This cash generation demonstrates the quality and liquidity of the portfolio and facilitates the rotation of the portfolio from direct investments to focus on investing in Pollen Street managed funds.\nInvestment Company Segment 2024 2023 Investment Assets £504 million £533 million Average Net Investment Assets £330 million £344 million Income on Net Investment Assets £31.8 million £30.2 million Return on Net Investment Assets 9.6% 8.8% This transition has continued to progress during the year with £196 million committed to Pollen Street managed funds at the year end. These commitments were £130 million drawn as at 31 December 2024, and are expected to continue to draw over the investment period of the funds. As at 31 December 2024, the investment portfolio was £504 million (2023: £533 million). The phased drawdown of fund commitments combined with the high cash realisations in the year has led to a reduction in the size of the overall asset portfolio and a corresponding reduction in the debt position of the Group with a reduction in the debt-to-tangible-equity ratio from 60 per cent to 53 per cent.\nWe completed a new 4-year £200 million senior debt facility on 10 June 2024 refinancing the previous facility and achieving a lower margin. This was subsequently upsized to £240 million on 13 December 2024 to refinance certain SPV facilities which enable us to reduce the operating cost base. The total drawn leverage for the Group was £188.3 million (2023: £210.8 million). In addition, the Group had £11.2 million (2023: £19.7 million) of cash resulting in a strong liquidity position and a net debt-to-tangible equity ratio of 50 per cent (2023: 54 per cent).\nPOLLEN STREET 21 Strategic Report",

      "text": "PROFIT BEFORE TAX AND TAX Profit before Tax for the Group increased by 31 per cent to £55.8 million for 2024 (2023: £42.6 million). The main drivers of this are the increase of £11.3 million in the Operating Profit from the Asset Manager segment, a £1.6 million increase in Operating Profit of the Investment Company.\nThe charge for depreciation and amortisation is £2.4 million (2023: £1.9 million). This relates to a charge of £0.3 million (2023: £0.3 million) associated with the depreciation of the Group’s fixed assets, a charge of £1.5 million (2023: £1.0 million) associated with the depreciation of the Group’s leased assets and a charge of £0.6 million (2023: £0.6 million) associated with the amortisation of intangible assets representing the value of customer relationships.\nAs a result of the Reorganisation, the Group now incurs corporation tax on all of its activities as the Investment Company is no longer an investment trust. The current tax charge for the period was £3.1 million (2023:\n£0.3 million), benefitting from unused tax losses arising from previously incurred management expenses in the Investment Company following the Reorganisation.\nThe Group is now also able to recognise a deferred tax asset of £3.3 million as at 31 December 2024 (2023:\nnil) in respect of the balance of these unused tax losses.\nThis deferred tax asset is expected to crystallise fully in 2025. The Group also recognised a deferred tax liability in respect of the recognition of fair value gains within the Investment Company and carried interest in the Asset Manager. The deferred tax liability of £8.9 million (2023:\n£3.1 million) will crystallise as the realised gain from these begins to flow to the Group in the medium term.\nThe deferred tax charge for the year was £3.1 million (2023: £2.4 million). The effective tax rate for 2024 was 11.1 per cent (2023: 17.8 per cent3).\nAs detailed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Group has a lower effective tax rate than the UK statutory rate. This is largely driven by timing differences on the taxation of management fee income and significant tax loss carry-forwards in the UK due to certain forms of income that are not subject to UK corporation tax. We expect the effective tax rate to increase going forward.\n2024 (£ million) 2023 (£ million) Operating Profit of Asset Manager 27.2 15.9 Operating Profit of Investment Company 31.8 30.2 Operating Loss of Central segment (0.8) (1.6) Operating Profit of Group 58.2 44.5 Depreciation and amortisation (2.4) (1.9)4 Profit before Tax 55.8 42.6 Corporation tax (6.2) (2.7) Profit after Tax 49.6 39.9 3\t Denominator used for 2023 is the Fund Management EBITDA given the investment trust status prior to the Reorganisation.\n4 The Reorganisation has been accounted for using the book-value method meaning that the financial statements are restated as if the Reorganisation had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented, i.e. from 1 January 2023. Under IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, depreciation and amortisation were not incurred when Pollen Street Capital Holdings Limited was held for sale. Under the book-value method of accounting, this is unwound and the prior year comparatives reflect a full year charge for depreciation (additional £240k) and amortisation (additional £160k).\nPOLLEN STREET 22 Annual Report and Accounts 2024",

The Board is pleased to confirm a second (and final) interim dividend for the period ended 31 December 2024 of 27.1 pence per share, amounting to a total payment of £16.5 million. This dividend, combined with the interim dividend payment of £16.5 million, is consistent with the Group’s guidance that it will pay a dividend of no lower than £33.0 million in respect of 2024 and that dividends will grow progressively thereafter. This represents a £0.9 million increase on the total dividend paid in respect of 2023 of £32.1 million.\nDuring 2024, following completion of the Reorganisation and conversion to a commercial company, the timing of dividend payments was changed to allow for dividends to be declared on a semi-annual, rather than a quarterly, basis. As a result of this re-phasing there was a one-off reduction in dividend payments paid in 2024, from £32.1 million in 2023 to £24.9 million in 2024. Prior to conversion to a commercial company, net interest income was distributed to shareholders through dividends designated as interest distributions. As a commercial company, whilst maintaining a progressive dividend policy, it is expected that the Group will retain an increasing share of earnings in order to re-invest in value creation opportunities in line with the Capital Allocation Framework.\nThe second interim dividend will be paid on 2 May 2025 to shareholders on the share register at the record date, being 4 April 2025. The ex-dividend date will be 3 April 2025. Pollen Street operates a Dividend Re-Investment Programme (“DRIP”), details of which are available from the Company’s Registrars, Computershare. The final date for DRIP elections will be 9 April 2025.\nDuring 2024, we completed an initial share buyback programme with a commitment of up to £30.0 million, reflecting the confidence we have in the resilience of our business and the attractive fundamental value and prospects of the Group. At 31 December 2024, £22.9 million had been used to repurchase 3,222,257 shares.\nOUTLOOK The Group remains in a strong position and is strategically well-placed and well-resourced for further growth in 2025 and beyond. Fund Management Income is expected to continue to grow with the final close of Private Equity Fund V above its target of €1 billion, and further capital raises in Private Credit Fund IV and their subsequent deployment under the Private Credit strategies. The balance sheet has delivered stable and robust performance with a healthy balance of direct positions and investments in Pollen Street managed funds to ensure alignment with Limited Partner interests. The Group is trading in line with expectations.\nIn accordance with the Capital Allocation Framework announced in 2024, the Group intends to continue to pay a progressive dividend and may return surplus capital to shareholders through share buybacks.\nModerate growth in the dividend, below the level of earnings growth, will allow dividend cover to increase over time. Any share buybacks will be subject to Board approval and will be evaluated against other value-creation opportunities available.\nCrispin Goldsmith Chief Financial Officer 24 March 2025 POLLEN STREET 23 Strategic Report",

      "text": "OUR APPROACH At Pollen Street we are committed to investing responsibly. Our aim is to invest and operate in a way that delivers positive outcomes for our investors, our people, our industry and wider society. We achieved a great deal over the year, working alongside our portfolio companies and borrowers as we believe that ESG is one of the tools that enables us to build better, more sustainable businesses. Early in our investment process our scoring mechanism allows us to identify potential risks and opportunities, helping us to make more informed decisions and ultimately invest in fairer, more transparent businesses that have the foundations to grow quickly and sustainably.\nIn 2024, Pollen Street continued to make progress, helping portfolio companies to achieve their sustainability goals. This has been achieved through the spotlight on data and scoring, crossportfolio collaboration, and effective monitoring and measurement including the continued roll-out of ESG ratchets in Private Credit which we believe benefit both our borrowers and our investors by enhancing the sustainability of investment returns. We have also been working to strengthen our approach to reporting and climate risk management, considering the evolving regulatory environment.\nHIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE:\nContinuing to drive strong governance which is core to our operating model, where we believe that a fairer, more transparent business supports strong and sustainable growth. In 2024, this included a focus on supply chain sustainability.\nStrengthening social responsibility through investment in capabilities for products and propositions that have a social impact, and a people-first approach to drive business success.\nFocus on ESG data and analytics with this being the third year of using ESG scores in our proprietary data model. We score and rank our investments in both Private Equity and Private Credit and track progress against the previous years. The Private Equity companies improved their scores by an average of 9 per cent compared to the prior year, and we used the scoring with borrowers in Private Credit, with 16 ESG margin ratchets now in place (2023: 8).\nStrengthening approaches to climate risk by understanding and mitigating climate risks within the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) framework. We are pleased to announce that 100 per cent of our portfolio companies are aligned to the Private Markets Decarbonisation Roadmap and are capturing their carbon emissions, with 74 per cent already preparing decarbonisation plans.\nDRIVING PROGRESS We track our commitment to positive ESG outcomes through direct and measurable goals. Pollen Street has set a number of targets at both Group and portfolio level. These include:\n• Pollen Street is committed to promoting strong governance throughout the portfolio including the inclusion of ESG matters on all portfolio company board agendas, as well as comprehensive policy coverage; and • Pollen Street is maintaining a carbon neutral status for each year at the corporate level and working with our portfolio companies to be net zero within five years of investment (for new investments after 2021).\nAlison Collins Head of ESG RESPONSIBLE INVESTING POLLEN STREET 24 Annual Report and Accounts 2024\n\n[IMAGE]\nCaption: Image extracted from document",

As a core part of our investment process, we engage with both our Private Equity and Private Credit partners to identify ESG risks and opportunities that are relevant to them and where we can support them. Further information on our approach is set out in our 2023 ESG report (https://content.pollencap.com/public/esg/pollen_ street_esg_report_2023.pdf).\nINCREASING SUSTAINABILITY ENGAGEMENT AND COLLABORATION ACROSS INVESTMENTS We are committed to promoting positive societal and environmental impacts directly in the companies we invest in and the products they offer. But we can also amplify this impact through the support and influence we have on our portfolio, with funding for more sustainability initiatives or simply access to our resources and expertise.\nIn 2024, we continued to invest in businesses that provide products and propositions that deliver a positive impact. In Private Equity, we invested in Keylane Group BV (“Keylane”) who provide robust SaaS solutions that helps insurance companies adhere to strict compliance regulations, which promote a sustainable, long-term insurance industry.\nIn Private Credit, we lent to Fundu Limited (“Fundu”), which provides funding to help grow the Finnish economy, backed by Government guarantees.\nSCORING AND ANALYTICS - A DEDICATION TO HIGH-QUALITY ESG REPORTING AND TRANSPARENCY Pollen Street employs a comprehensive datadriven approach to ESG integration, leveraging precise analytics to drive meaningful engagement and sustainable business practices across our portfolio. Our proprietary scoring methodology processes detailed ESG metrics to identify areas for enhancement, enabling the development of robust policies and procedures.\nWe collect over 50 ESG metrics from each portfolio company annually, using the score to track progress through comprehensive dashboards and scorecards, driving action plans during the year. For new investments, the Pollen Street ESG team uses the scores to develop detailed post-investment plans with specific short, medium, and long-term objectives, designed to progress toward our standards for sustainable business practices.\nDuring 2024, this data framework ensured alignment with industry standards and reporting requirements, including the UN PRI, the ESG Data Convergence Initiative (“EDCI”), and Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulations (“SFDR”).\nLooking ahead, we continue to look for opportunities to enhance our ESG reporting capabilities, focusing on automation and efficiency improvements to deliver more granular insights. This commitment enables increasingly tangible ESG improvements across the portfolio while meeting growing demands for standardised, transparent reporting.\nWe will publish more details, including relevant data points and scores for the 2024 reporting period, as part of our annual ESG report later this year.\nHIGHLIGHTS:\nAverage score for Portfolio Companies 14/18 Average Credit score improvement (out of 18) +3 5 Star rankings for both strategies in the UN PRI  Average ESG Scores by Companies’ Tenures in \u0003Portfolio 12.7 0-1 year 1-3 years 3+ years 13.6 15.0 POLLEN STREET 27 Strategic Report",

      "text": "ESG RATCHET TO STRENGTHEN COMMITMENTS TO ESG AND SUSTAINABILITY ACROSS OUR PRIVATE CREDIT STRATEGY ESG margin ratchets serve as a tool for better risk management. By incentivising borrowers to improve their ESG performance, we can potentially reduce long-term risks associated with environmental, social, and governance factors. We introduced ESG ratchets in 2022, and in 2024 eight new ESG ratchets were rolled out with our borrowers, bringing the strategy total to 16 active ratchets by the end of the year.\nThrough these ratchets we offer margin reductions to our lending facilities based on whether borrowers improve their ESG score or reach specific milestones such as net zero. There is a corresponding margin increase if their scores do not improve or meet agreed thresholds.\nThe ratchet provides a framework for Pollen Street to engage more closely with borrowers to understand and improve their scores, and to influence and support positive ESG developments. We’re pleased to be able to drive this positive impact and work more closely with our borrowers on these important issues, as well as to drive competitive advantage.\nCASE STUDY ESG ratchet drives sustainable performance Our partnership with Pollen Street has catalysed significant advancement in our Sustainability initiatives, beginning with the establishment of our ESG committee to drive sustainable improvements.\nWe launched “Foundations for Better Futures”, our ESG strategy, supported by Pollen Street’s analytical frameworks and tools. This enabled the ESG committee and Board to identify and act on key enhancement areas. Environmental achievements included implementing carbon emissions tracking and offsetting 125% of Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We strengthened employee engagement through our first satisfaction survey and ESG awareness programs.\nOur community investment delivered £37,000 in charitable contributions and engaged 250 participants in our Charity Volleyball tournament, while maintaining support for local food banks and community initiatives.\nThe Pollen Street partnership and ESG margin ratchet continue to enhance our ability to implement meaningful ESG initiatives aligned with our strategic objectives.\nNicky Hollamby Associate Director of Finance and Chair of MSP ESG Committee MSP Capital is a UK-based Development Finance provider. Pollen Street’s Private Credit team has partnered with the borrower since 2023 and has deployed an ESG margin ratchet as part of the loan facility.\nPOLLEN STREET 28 Annual Report and Accounts 2024\n\n[IMAGE]\nCaption: Image extracted from document",

Risk Identification and Assessment:\nWe aim to identify and assess climate-related risks associated with Pollen Street’s investment strategy, evaluating the potential physical, regulatory and transitional risks that may impact the long-term performance of our assets.\n2. Opportunity Analysis:\nRecognising that climate change presents not only risks but also opportunities, we explore how our investments can contribute to a more sustainable and resilient financial sector.\n3. Scenario Analysis:\nTo enhance our risk management capabilities, we conduct qualitative scenario analyses aligned with TCFD recommendations. These scenarios help us understand the potential impact of different climaterelated outcomes, and to make informed decisions.\n4. Disclosure of Findings:\nTransparent communication is essential in building trust with our stakeholders. We have described our progress against the 11 recommendations of the TCFD, across four key pillars of Governance, Strategy, Risk Management and Metrics and Targets.\nThrough these activities, we aim to establish standards for climate-conscious investment practices while positioning our portfolio companies and borrowers to succeed in an evolving regulatory and environmental landscape.\nCompliance statement Since 2022, the Group has reported voluntarily against the TCFD Disclosures and 2024 marks the first year of fulfilling the full requirements under the FCA listing rules.

This assessment considered both transition and physical climate risks.\nWe continued to work with a third-party experts as part of the exercise to strengthen our approach to climate risk, to support better understanding of the impacts a changing climate and the net zero transition has on Pollen Street’s operations and investments.\nThe work includes the following elements:\n•  TCFD diagnostic gap analysis and roadmap, reviewing how climate risks are incorporated into the Group’s risk management framework; •  Initial materiality assessment; •  Engaging external support to develop a long list of risks and opportunities; •  Internal workshop and engagement to prioritise risks and opportunities linked to different time horizons; and •  Qualitative scenario analysis.\nIdentifying and prioritising material climate risks and opportunities We assess climate-related risks and opportunities across our funds and the regions where we operate.\nWe have undertaken a qualitative climate-related risk and opportunity workshop with representatives from the investment teams and business functions.\nThe purpose was to score and summarise material transition and physical risks and opportunities relevant to the business, and which might result in indirect financial impacts to Pollen Street.\nMaterial risks are defined as those that have the potential to have a significant effect on our operations, strategy or financial performance if they are not suitably controlled. Material opportunities are those that have the potential to enhance the financial performance of the business.\nSTRATEGY The Strategy pillar includes the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation’s businesses, strategy and financial planning where such information is material. This includes the following areas as related to the TCFD framework:\nPOLLEN STREET 36 Annual Report and Accounts 2024",

Risks and opportunities were assessed as to the probability and potential impact, with the results presented below.\nClimate-related risk Time horizon Impact Management response In addition to climate risks, Pollen Street has identified and invested in opportunities to support solutions that support the transition to a sustainable economy, enabling businesses and individuals to improve their resilience to climate-related risks and contribute positively to sustainability goals.\nThese include investments in sectors such as electric vehicles and green home improvements.\nMarket Further integration of ESG factors into business processes Short- medium term Low Pollen Street is Further integrating ESG factors into investment processes as an opportunity to recognise the growing emphasis on risk management, enhance operational resilience and strategic decision-making.\nProducts & Services Investment opportunities that leverage shifts in consumer preferences to incorporate climate change mitigation Shortmedium term Medium Pollen Street actively identifies and invests in businesses that enable consumers and enterprises to adopt climate-conscious solutions in financial services, focusing particularly on opportunities in green lending, sustainable home improvements and low-carbon mobility.\nResilience Continue to pursue and improve an environmental sustainability strategy Short- medium term Low The team strengthens its environmental sustainability practices through enhancement of measurement, policies and portfolio engagement. The strategy is underpinned by comprehensive carbon measurement and leveraging industry best practice.\nDue to the nature of its operations and investments in the financial services sector, Pollen Street found that transition risks were most material to the business, with physical risks presenting a lower financial impact.\nAcute physical risks were considered a lower impact.\nThis is because Pollen Street operates in an officebased services sector and so impact to staff and operations is minimal, even in extreme conditions, resulting in low financial impact from disruptions to normal business operations.\nAs noted above, at a Group level we consider the impact of climate-related risks on the firm’s operations and financial statements to be low. However, the Group is dedicated to evaluating and addressing the impact of identified climate-related risks and opportunities.

      "text": "Addressing climate risk as part of the investment process We acknowledge that ESG risks and opportunities exist across our portfolio companies and borrowers - varying by sector, geography and investment duration. While we avoid investments that cause environmental harm, we take a balanced approach to managing these considerations.\nDuring our pre-investment evaluation, we place strong emphasis on ESG and environmental considerations.\nOur proprietary rating system assesses potential investments’ ESG performance, with environmental metrics forming a core component of our ongoing performance tracking. Our due diligence examines climate risks and environmental management, while evaluating potential climate opportunities specific to each business and sector. We facilitate knowledge sharing across our portfolio through regular ESG and climate-focused forums.\nWe will continue to update and improve due diligence processes for both Private Equity and Private Credit strategies to include additional climate risk considerations.\nFinancial Planning We will be strengthening our financial planning processes to incorporate climate-related scenarios and potential impacts over different time horizons, documenting as appropriate. This will help us understand how different climate-related outcomes may affect the financial performance of our investments, allowing us to make informed decisions and develop robust strategies for the future.\nScenario Analysis As part of our engagement with SLR Consulting, we have conducted preliminary qualitative scenario analysis to evaluate identified climate risks. This assessment examined vulnerability, likelihood, and impact across three scenarios (orderly transition, disorderly transition, and hot house world) over short, medium, and long-term horizons.\nThe climate risks identified above were assessed under the different scenarios, and of the six identified risks, only one “Market - Changes in market dynamics due to climate trends may lead to fluctuations in asset value” was deemed to be medium risk under the orderly transition scenario. All other risks were scored low under all scenarios.\nCLIMATE SCENARIOS Orderly Transition Disorderly Transition Hot House World Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) (selected scenarios for the workshop in bold) • Net Zero 2050 • Below 2°C • Delayed Transition • Divergent Net Zero • Current Policies • Nationally Determined Contributions Approx. temperature increase 1.0-2.0°C 2.1-3.5°C 3.0-5.0°C + Description Decisive global policy action is taken to limit global warming from early 2020s.\nPolicy measures are delayed until late 2020s/ early 2030s meaning increased costs, e.g., higher carbon prices.\nNo new policies are introduced leading to increasing physical impacts.\nLess warming ➔ requires stricter climate policy ➔ increased transition Higher warming ➔ greater physical risks POLLEN STREET 39 Strategic Report\n\n[IMAGE]\nCaption: Image extracted from document",

THE ORGANISATION’S PROCESSES FOR IDENTIFYING AND ASSESSING CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS As set out in the risk management & principal risks and uncertainties section on page 41, the Group has developed a comprehensive risk management framework, with the Board overseeing the management of key and emerging risks, including climate and other ESG risks, which are included on the Group risk register. A working group that reports into the ESG Committee analyses and reviews climate-related risks and opportunities on a regular basis, refreshing the risk register and associated reporting as necessary.\nWe assess climate-related risks and opportunities across our investment portfolio. This includes analysing both physical risks and transition risks. We also consider the potential impact of climate-related risks on different asset classes and sectors.\nThe Group has a set of minimum standards to ensure climate change risks are assessed and measured within the investment process, which are incorporated into initial deal team investment assessments and ongoing portfolio management. This includes reviewing counterparty approach to environmental factors and collecting metrics to identify the environmental impacts of their operations, and to implement reasonable measures to minimise any negative impacts.\nRISK MANAGEMENT Across the investment process, climate-related risks are reviewed and addressed as per the below.\nPOLLEN STREET 41 Strategic Report",

THE ORGANISATION’S PROCESSES FOR MANAGING CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS Any climate-related risks are managed by the ESG and investment teams with support from other parts of the business as appropriate. The risks are also subject to challenge from our second line risk management function and on the roadmap of our internal audit programme.\nAt the investment level, through active ownership and engagement, we partner closely with portfolio companies to advance their ESG practice and to address any climate risks. Our approach includes ensuring board-level accountability for ESG and establishing dedicated ESG contacts at each company. We proactively guide all portfolio companies to align with the Private Markets Decarbonisation Roadmap and facilitate carbon measurement by connecting them with specialised carbon accounting partners. Additionally, we provide support on decarbonisation and net zero verification approaches, helping companies validate their environmental claims.\n8. PROCESSES FOR THE INTEGRATION OF IDENTIFYING, ASSESSING AND MANAGING CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS INTO THE ORGANISATION’S OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT By integrating climate-related risks into our risk management framework, we aim to enhance the long-term resilience and sustainability of the Group. We continuously monitor and review our risk management practices adapting to evolving climate-related challenges and seize opportunities for sustainable growth. Our commitment to effective risk management ensures that we are well-positioned to navigate the changing landscape of climate-related risks, and capitalise on the opportunities presented by the transition to a low-carbon economy.\nThe monitoring of climate-related risks is integrated into Pollen Street’s existing risk management and investment monitoring processes. Identified climate risks are monitored on a regular basis, including progress against ESG roadmaps, initiatives and KPIs.\nIn addition, the ESG team, with support from the investment teams, conducts an annual portfolio-wide ESG review which includes climate-related risks.\nOver the last year we have developed our proprietary ESG scoring model and we measure carbon footprint across the firm and portfolio. This enables us to analyse and track progress against our net zero targets, as well as to identify further improvement opportunities.\nThe Group’s climate risk management priorities for 2025 are:\nenhance the integration of climate-related risks within our corporate risk management framework; strengthen our climate risk analysis and reporting capabilities through improved tools and a data driven approach; and enhance our climate risk management processes by utilising industry-leading frameworks and insights from Initiative Climat International.\nPOLLEN STREET 42 Annual Report and Accounts 2024",

METRICS USED BY THE ORGANISATION TO ASSESS CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN LINE WITH ITS STRATEGY AND RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS.\nAs part of our annual ESG data collection, we regularly monitor a broad range of climate-related metrics along with a wider set of ESG measures. The metrics that we track range from standardised KPIs such as the adoption of climate-related policies and appropriate governance through to KPIs specific to individual portfolio companies. We also measure and report on greenhouse gas emissions from across all Private Equity portfolio companies and Private Credit counterparties, using a third party to undertake the assessment. We also incorporate climate-related metrics into our ESG scoring mechanism, which is used as a basis to target ESG improvements and action plans for portfolio companies and borrowers.\nKey metrics tracked with results from latest available portfolio measures (2023):\n•\t carbon emissions tracking - Scope 1,2 and 3 GHG emissions;\n\n-\t PE companies: Scope 1: 3,851 tCO2e, Scope 2:\n1,554 tCO2e, Scope 3: 18,113 tCO2e (excluding purchased goods and services) •\t implementation and status of net zero commitments and decarbonisation strategies; and\n\n-\t 46% of PE companies have net zero commitments •\t % of renewable energy usage.\n\n-\t 71% of PE companies source renewable energy tariffs For credit facilities which have ESG margin ratchets in place, a key factor is also on achieving accredited net zero targets.\nWe have adopted the Private Markets Decarbonisation roadmap as a framework for understanding the portfolio’s decarbonisation activities and progress towards net zero. Data on alignment is collected as part of the annual ESG data collection and used to help guide and set decarbonisation targets across the portfolio, leveraging science-based targets methodologies or equivalent.\nFurther metrics and targets will be developed to link to specified climate risks and opportunities. As the Group’s investments are within Financial and Business services which are asset light, financed emissions for investments do not have a direct correlation with identified climate risks.\nMETRICS AND TARGETS POLLEN STREET 43 Strategic Report",

Additionally, we source 100% renewable electricity for our London offices, helping to lower our Scope 2 emissions in accordance with the market-based GHG protocol methodology. We also continuously refine our processes and technologies to enhance energy efficiency and minimise travel where feasible.\nWhile we acknowledge that these efforts alone do not eliminate our operational emissions, we offset our remaining carbon footprint by purchasing accredited carbon credits, ensuring we maintain carbon-neutral status. These offsets cover our Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions, as detailed in the table above.\n11.

In addition to committing to carbon neutral status for each year, we will consider net zero commitments in the coming period.\nWe are working with portfolio companies to set net zero commitments within five years of Pollen Street investment. Working with Initiative Climat International, using the Private Markets Decarbonisation roadmap to map the activities and progress towards this goal as detailed above. We also score portfolio companies on their climate and environmental management strategies as part of our deal scoring model, setting expectations to improve practice in this area and to put in place meaningful carbon reduction plans. We use these scores as part of an ESG margin ratchet for Private Credit investments, subject to achieving ESG performance targets.\nOur priorities for metrics and targets for 2025 are:\nexpand and refine our carbon emissions measurement, focusing on comprehensive Scope 3 and financed emissions across our investment portfolio with an ongoing focus on data quality; support the adoption of science-based net zero targets at both Group and portfolio level, ensuring meaningful and measurable commitments across our investments; and monitor and support portfolio companies’ progress on decarbonisation initiatives, aligned with the Private Markets decarbonisation roadmap.\nAlison Collins Head of ESG 24 March 2025 POLLEN STREET 45 Strategic Report",

Our shareholders view the dividend policy complementing the Group’s growth strategy as key components of value creation along with the support of the Buyback program. This comprehensive view of shareholder value creation reflects the multifaceted approach of our investors and our shareholder engagement process.\nKey Priorities for 2025 We will continue to engage with our shareholders regularly to maximise the engagement.

We also conduct an annual engagement and DEI survey, allowing us to collect DEI data and understand employee engagement and sentiment. Results of our survey are published in our annual ESG report and we report back to employees the results of the survey. In response to the feedback collated we agree tangible actions for the year ahead; a competency-based recruitment process, supported with unconscious-bias and interview training to ensure fair and equal opportunities for all candidates and to enhance diversity of thought within our teams; an employee engagement strategy focusing on annual events and observances that acts as a conduit for bringing our people together and regular team-building events to continuously strengthen our working relationships, company culture and shared values.

      "text": "RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK The Group has developed a comprehensive risk management framework that ensures that the Group identifies, monitors, mitigates and manages risk with oversight from the risk committees and the boards. The Group’s risk management framework includes risk identification, risk appetite, accountability, risk limits, controls and reporting. These components, when used together, enable effective oversight of risk across the Group. Under this framework there are a wide range of risk mitigants that are targeted at the risks to which the business is exposed. All areas of the business are engaged in the risk management work and the Group has a strong risk culture.\nThe risks arising from the pursuit of the business’ strategy, as well as the risks to achieving the Group’s strategy have been analysed carefully and arrangements in place are appropriate and proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent in the business model and the activities of the Group. Challenge comes through the first, second and third lines of defence; the Group has established committees that oversee specific areas of the business, each of which will report to the relevant governing bodies.\nThe risk management process can be split into five main areas.\nRISK IDENTIFICATION The Group periodically reviews its risk profile using a range of techniques.\nBoth current risks and emerging risks are considered where assessment is informed by material risk events that may have occurred during the period, lessons learnt from previous events or near misses, and any changes to the external risk landscape such as new investment opportunities, operational complexity, regulatory changes, and changes in the economic climate.\nRISK ANALYSIS An assessment process takes place including risk analysis, description, and estimation. The Group has classified its risk exposure into five principal risks:\nreputation, strategic, conduct, financial and operational. The principal risks are broken down into smaller risks to help to identify and articulate the risks to which the group is exposed and to ensure the risk registers are a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive map of all risks within the Group.\nRISK EVALUATION Risks are evaluated, and ranked and prioritised taking into account the Group’s Risk Appetite Statement which outlines the level and type of risk tolerated in pursuit of our strategic objectives and financial goals. Risk evaluation allows a holistic view of the risk exposure of the Group to be achieved.\nRISK TREATMENT A comprehensive assessment of identified risks has been undertaken, ensuring that the Group is well-positioned to manage those risks inherent in its business model. Implementing robust risk controls helps mitigate the risks associated with the Group’s activities. Preventative, corrective, directive, and detective controls are widely used in the pursuit of mitigating risks and harms to the Group.\nRISK MONITORING AND REVIEW A clear organisational structure with well defined, transparent, and consistent lines of responsibility exists, and effective processes to manage, monitor, and report the risks the Group is or might be exposed to, or the Group poses or might pose to others, have been implemented.

Conflict escalation in the Middle East and Ukraine continued to threaten global stability. The results of political elections held globally during the year heightened market volatility, and secular megatrends - from AI to sustainability - accelerated and reshaped economies and industries and look to continue to do so. Decarbonisation, digitisation, deglobalisation, destabilisation in geopolitics, and demographic aging look to be structural forces as we head into the new year.\nDespite the global challenges witnessed throughout 2024, the Group’s overall risk profile has remained relatively stable. We continue to navigate the challenges presented to us and ensure preparedness considering both current and emerging risks.\nIn addition to navigating key risks, opportunities also exist, and we hope that 2025 will be a year of transformation and consolidation for the industry if we are able to harness technological advancements and adapt to changing investor preferences.\nAs we enter 2025, we remain confident that we are best placed to learn from the challenges presented to us and emerge stronger.\n56 POLLEN STREET Annual Report and Accounts 2024",

      "text": "EMERGING RISK IDENTIFICATION The Risk Management Function continually scans the horizon to identify and communicate emerging risks facing the Group, which are expected to have a significant impact within 1 to 10 years. Emerging risks are those which may arise, or ones that already exist but have evolved. They are characterised by a high degree of uncertainty in terms of impact and likelihood and may have a substantial impact on the operations of the Group.\nThe Group monitors its emerging risks, supporting organisational readiness for external volatility, incorporating input and insight from both a top-down and bottom-up perspective:\n•  Top-down: Emerging risks identified by the Risk Committee and the Board, helping to define the overall attitude of the Group to risk.\n•  Bottom-up: Emerging risks identified at a business level and escalated where appropriate by the Risk and Operations Committee.\nKey emerging risks for 2025 include:\n•  AI and machine learning integration: Increasing integration of AI and machine learning, along with broader economic, political, and cultural changes will affect investment strategies and how firms operate presenting both opportunities and risks.\n•  Cybersecurity risks: An existing risk which looks to continue throughout 2025 and beyond. AI enabled cyber-attacks, including AI-driven threats and ransomware are becoming more sophisticated.\n•  Geopolitical instability and economic volatility:\nOngoing global tensions may affect market stability and exacerbate operational risks.\nThe Risk Committee will continue to monitor these risks and proactively respond to the evolving risk landscape.\nWe are committed to continuously enhancing the firm’s operational resilience and driving strategic improvements in our resilience capabilities through comprehensive risk assessment, technology and infrastructure investment, and governance and oversight.\nVIABILITY STATEMENT The Company has chosen to voluntarily comply with the requirements of Listing Rules 6.6.6R(3) and present a Viability Statement. Therefore, the Directors have carried out a comprehensive and vigorous assessment of the prospects of the Group over the three-year period to Pollen Street Group Limited’s AGM in 2028. The Board believes this period to be appropriate for assessing viability, considering the Group’s current trading position, the potential impact of principal risks, and aligning with the recommendations of the Financial Reporting Council’s 2021 thematic review.\nThe Group’s long-term prospects are primarily assessed through the strategic and financial planning process, culminating in the Board-approved Group Budget. As of the year-end, the Group’s in a strong financial position, with cash balances of £11.2 million and £579.4 million of net assets, coupled with good visibility of future management fees and a largely predictable cost base, supports its ongoing viability.\nTo prepare the viability statement, the Board has considered the prospects of the Group in light of its current position and has considered each of the Group’s principal risks, uncertainties and mitigating factors that are detailed on pages 57 to 60, to develop a comprehensive scenario analysis for viability.\nThese projections consider the Group’s income, net asset value and the cash flows over the three-year period under a range of scenarios. The scenarios are not a business plan in itself, but rather a prudent view of how the Group may evolve, based principally upon its growth to date, in order to demonstrate its viability. Analysis to assess viability focused on the risks of delivery of the growth of the business and a series of projections have been considered, including changing new business volumes and the performance of the Investment Assets.\nKey assumptions within the scenario analysis include:\n•  the raising of new funds, which impacts the amount of management fees; •  the timing and level of returns from funds, which impacts co-investment and carried interest cash flows and profit recognition; and •  changes in the cost base, primarily in relation to people costs and inflation.\nPOLLEN STREET 61 Strategic Report",

      "text": "Progress against the current year’s budget, which underpins the Strategic Plan, is monitored through the year.\nThe stressed scenarios applied were deliberately challenging, with the combined scenario representing an extreme case. While the testing identified potential pressures on liquidity in the most severe cases, the Board concluded that the Group has sufficient mitigating actions available.\nThe recent geopolitical and macroeconomic disruption has also been considered in these scenarios.\nAll the analysis indicates that due to the stability and cash-generating nature of the Investment Asset portfolio, as well as the long-term debt facilities in place, the Group would be able to withstand the impact of the risks identified. Based on the robust assessment of the principal risks, prospects and viability of the Group, the Board confirms that they have reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue operating and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period to Pollen Street Group Limited’s AGM in 2028. The Board also continuously monitors the financial performance of the Group against key financial metrics and ratios, ensuring a strict discipline in the financial management of the business.\nGOING CONCERN The Group has chosen to voluntarily comply with the requirements of Listing Rules 6.6.6R(3) and present a going concern statement. This statement includes the Directors’ assessment of the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and their evaluation of the Group’s prospects, in line with Provisions 30 and 31 of the UK Corporate Governance Code.\nThe Directors have reviewed the financial projections of the Group, which show that the Group will be able to generate sufficient cash flows in order to meet its liabilities as they fall due within 12 months from the date of this Annual Report and Accounts. The Group benefits from income from long-term fund management contracts, with a significant majority of forecast management fees in the assessment period from funds that have already been raised.\nThe firm benefits from a largely predictable cost base, of which over three quarters is personnel related. Based on the above there is good visibility of income, expenditure and future profitability during and beyond the period covered by this assessment.\nThese financial projections have been performed for the Group under various new business volumes and stressed scenarios, and in all cases the Group is able to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The stressed scenarios included no new fundraising and late repayments of a number of structured facilities.\nThe Directors consider these scenarios to be the most relevant risks to the Group’s operations. Finally, the Directors reviewed financial and non-financial covenants in place for its debt facility with no breaches anticipated, even in the stressed scenario.\nThe Directors are satisfied that the going concern basis remains appropriate for the preparation of the financial statements. The Group also has detailed policies and processes for managing the risk, set out in the Strategic Report on pages 57 to 60.\nPOLLEN STREET Annual Report and Accounts 2024 62\n\n[IMAGE]\nCaption: Image extracted from document",

On 14 February 2024, Pollen Street Limited distributed the entire issued share capital of Pollen Street Capital Holdings Limited to the Company, this is referred to as the “Distribution”. The Scheme and the Distribution are together referred to as the “Reorganisation”.\nThe Reorganisation did not change the activities of the overall business for Pollen Street Group Limited and its subsidiaries. However, it did change the activities of the companies within the Group and it affected the presentation of the financial statements.\nFrom 24 January 2024, Pollen Street Limited ceased to be classified as an investment trust and Pollen Street Limited and its subsidiaries ceased all asset management activities, however they continue their operations of making both direct investments and investments in funds managed by Pollen Street.\nFurther information on the Reorganisation is provided in Note 1 to the Financial Statements.\nThe information regarding the Company’s principal activities and business review and details of the Directors’ overarching duty in relation to The Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008 are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 52 to 53.\nBOARD MEMBERS The names and biographical details of the Board members who served on the Board as at the yearend can be found on pages 64 to 65.\nDuring the year there were two board changes, Julian Dale stepped down as Chief Financial Officer and executive director with effect from 13 June 2024 and Lucy Tilley was appointed as Chief Financial Officer and as an executive director from 13 June 2024 to 18 October 2024. On 18 October 2024 by mutual agreement with the Board and the Company, Lucy Tilley stepped down as Chief Financial Officer and executive director. On 6 January 2025, Crispin Goldsmith was appointed as Chief Financial Officer, but has not been appointed as an executive director.\nRE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS In accordance with the Code and the Articles, all Directors are subject to annual re-election by shareholders at the AGM.

Prior to 24 January 2024 the Company was a private limited company with one shareholder and its only activity was in relation to the Reorganisation. It is the holding company of Pollen Street Limited and Pollen Street Capital Holdings Limited.\nSHARE CAPITAL As at 31 December 2024, the Company had 60,987,340 ordinary shares in issue, excluding treasury shares. The total number of shares in issue, including shares held in treasury was 64,209,597 (2023: 2 ordinary shares in issue). As part of the Scheme, 64,209,597 shares in Pollen Street Limited were transferred to the Company.\nThe authority granted to Pollen Street Limited at the 2023 AGM to buyback or allot shares was transferred to the Company in accordance with the Scheme.\nOn 21 March 2024 the Company announced a Buyback Programme. 3,222,257 shares have been purchased by the Company during the year ended 31 December 2024 and held in treasury and no further shares have been purchased up to 24 March 2025 being the latest practical date prior to the issue of this report. There are currently 3,222,257 shares held in treasury.\nAt the AGM in June 2024 authority was given by the shareholders for the Company to purchase its own shares and allot shares. The Company will again request authority to buyback or allot shares at the 2025 AGM. As per the 2024 AGM, in addition to there being a Concert Party which is deemed a controlling shareholder, the resolution to waive Rule 9 of the Takeover Code in Connection with the Exercise by the Company of the Authority to Make Market Purchases of Ordinary Shares will be put to the Shareholders. Without approval of this waiver, the Company is unable to conduct purchases of its own shares. Concerns have been raised that the Concert Party’s shareholding would increase as a result of any market purchases, but following buybacks in 2024, the increase in shareholding has been less than 1 per cent and the Concert Party aims not to increase its current shareholding level in case a share repurchase is taking place and it is committed to the success of the Group and maintaining the business.\nOn a winding up or a return of capital by the Company, the ordinary shareholders are entitled to the capital of the Company.\nDIVIDENDS & DIVIDEND POLICY During 2024 and as part of the Reorganisation the Group changed its dividend policy from a quarterly basis to a bi-annual dividend. As such the Company paid its first interim dividend in October 2024 following the release of the Interim Report. At the Company’s AGM on 13 June 2024, shareholder approval was given for two dividend payments in relation to 2024, therefore no further shareholder approval is needed for the second (and final) interim dividend approved by the Board for 2024, which will be paid on 2 May 2025. For 2025 onwards this will be made up of an interim and final dividend.\nThe dividends in relation to or paid during the year ended 31 December 2024 by the Company and Pollen Street Limited and the year ended 31 December 2023 by Pollen Street Limited are set out in Note 22. A reconciliation of movements in reserves is presented in the Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Funds on pages 125 to 126.\nThe Company may make distributions from retained earnings, revenue reserves, special distributable reserves or from realised capital gains.\nPollen Street declared an interim dividend of 26.5 pence per share in relation to the first half of the year and intends to declare 27.1 pence per share as a second interim dividend, in relation to the financial year 2024.\nSUBSTANTIAL SHARE INTERESTS Up to the Scheme on 24 January 2024 the Company was wholly owned by Joanne Lake. The following table shows the parties that, either held 5 per cent or more in the issued share capital of Pollen Street Limited at the time of the Scheme or have advised the Company during the period to 31 December 2024, that they have an interest of 5 per cent or more of the issued share capital of the Company pursuant to Rule 5 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (“DTR”) for non-UK issuers.\nPOLLEN STREET 67 Corporate Governance Report",

      "text": "Financial Statement 2022 POLLEN STREET CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT Introduction from the Chair I am pleased to introduce this year’s Corporate Governance Statement and my last as Chair of the Board, it has been a pleasure working with the Pollen Street Board and overseeing the evolution of the Group in recent years. I am confident that the governance framework that we have established will permit a seamless transition to a new Chair.\nIn this statement we explain how the Company operated in 2024 and complied with relevant corporate governance standards. This corporate governance statement forms part of the Directors’ Report.\nThe Directors are ultimately responsible for the stewardship of the Company and this section explains how the Directors have fulfilled their corporate governance responsibilities. The Board remains fully committed to high standards of corporate governance.\nThe governance arrangements were reviewed as part of the Reorganisation. These reviews concluded that the governance arrangements were appropriate for the Group. Therefore, the governance arrangements of the Company were established to be consistent with those of Pollen Street Limited prior to the delisting of its shares.\nFrom 24 January 2024 the Company was an equity shares commercial company (“ESCC”) on the London Stock Exchange, as such, the Company complies with the Listing Rules, the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (the “Code 2018”) and Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008 as amended.\nThe Board reviewed the Principles and Provisions of the Code 2018 and its compliance with the Code 2018 throughout 2024 and has looked to update its corporate governance practices in line with the 2024 Corporate Governance Code that came into effect from 1 January 2025. Following this review, the Board is pleased to confirm that the Company has applied the Code 2018 Principles and complied in full with the Provisions for the financial year ended 31 December 2024 except in relation to provisions 5, 17 and 19.\nProvision 5 is addressed on page 50, provision 17 is addressed on page 92 and provision 19 is addressed on pages 72 and 76.\nThe Code 2018 was published by the Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”) in July 2018. A copy of the Code 2018 is available from the website of the FRC at www.frc.org.uk. During the year the Company has worked to incorporate the changes made by the 2024 UK Corporate Governance Code (“Code 2024”) and has applied the Code 2024 from 1 January 2025. The internal control requirements of the Code 2024 do not come into effect until 1 January 2026 so the Group is working on implementing these non-financial controls to ensure compliance when they come into effect. A copy of the Code 2024 is available from the website of the FRC at www.frc.org.uk.\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS The Board currently consists of six Directors:\nfive Non-Executive Directors and one Executive Director. Four of the Non-Executive Directors are considered independent. However, it is noted that the Chair is not subject to an ongoing independence test. Despite Mr. Coyle reaching his 9 year tenure in December 2024 and Ms Lake being stated as a non-independent executive director in the Company’s 2023 Annual Report and Accounts, alongside Mr Rowney, both of these Directors are deemed to be fully independent directors.\nBiographies of the Directors are shown on pages 64 to 65 and demonstrate the wide range of skills and experience that they bring to the Board. The Directors possess business and financial expertise relevant to the direction of the Company and consider POLLEN STREET 71 Corporate Governance Report",

      "text": "themselves to be committing sufficient time to the Company’s affairs.\nEach Non-Executive Director has been appointed pursuant to a letter of appointment entered into with the Company in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. The Directors’ appointment can be terminated in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and without compensation.\nThere are no agreements between the Company and any Director which provide for compensation for loss of office in the event that there is a change of control of the Company. Each Executive Director has entered into a service agreement with the Group as set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.\nCopies of the letters of appointment and service agreements are available on request from the Company Secretary and will be available at the Pollen Street Group Limited’s 2025 AGM.\nDuring the year Julian Dale stepped down as the CFO and as an Executive Director and from 13 June to 18 October 2024 Lucy Tilley was the CFO and an Executive Director on the Board.\nAt the Annual General Meeting in June 2024 Mr Sharpe noted in his speech that he and Mr Coyle would reach their nine-year tenure at the end of 2024 and therefore the Company would imminently commence the search for a new Chair.\nIn June 2024 Per Ardua Associates Limited were appointed to assist with the search for a new Chair and the Nomination Committee agreed that Mr Sharpe and Mr Coyle would lead the process and conduct first interviews with candidates before second round interviews with Ms McMurray. The search for a new chair is ongoing with several strong candidates identified and interviewed. Once the new chair has been identified the intention is for there to be a period of three months overlap with Mr Sharpe as the new chair transitions into the position.\nThe Board will be recommending the reappointment of Mr Coyle as a Director of the Company at the 2025 AGM. Mr Coyle reached 9 years of continuous appointment on the Boards of Pollen Street Limited and the Company in December 2024 and therefore, if re-elected, he will be serving as a Director beyond the nine-year recommended period of tenure. The Board considers that due to the recent change of Chair and the changes to CFO over the last year it would be in the best interest of the Company and shareholders that Mr Coyle remains as a Director, Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Audit Committee beyond the standard nine-year period. However, the search for a new director and replacement of Mr Coyle is in hand and Mr Coyle is expected to step down before the 2026 AGM. The Board believes that although Mr Coyle will be serving beyond a nine-year period (subject to re-election at the AGM), that Mr Coyle remains fully independent and is able to perform his role appropriately.\nWhilst Ms. Lake was the sole shareholder of the Company prior to the Scheme, her role was ministerial and was not a material business relationship, therefore as Ms. Lake is no longer the sole shareholder of the Company the Directors are of the opinion Ms Lake is fully independent and is able to perform her role appropriately. In addition, when she was appointed to the Board of Pollen Street Limited she was independent and remained independent until stepping down from the Board at the completion of the Scheme.\nTIME COMMITMENT The Nomination Committee considers the time commitments of proposed director candidates prior to appointment to ensure that they are able to dedicate sufficient time to the role. Directors’ external commitments are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they continue to devote sufficient time to the role. All Directors are required to obtain prior approval before taking on any additional external appointments.\nDirectors are expected to attend all Board and relevant Committee meetings and attendance in 2024 is set out in the table below. The Nomination Committee noted that some Directors have a number of other significant appointments. The Committee is satisfied that each Director has sufficient time to dedicate to Pollen Street, which is evidenced by attendance at Board and sub-committee meetings over 2024.\nThe Company noted the resolution to re-elect Joanne Lake at the 2024 AGM received 74.60 per cent due to concerns about over boarding. As stated by the Company on 18 June 2024 in an RNS, due to the small cap nature of each of her other directorships, the Board considers that Joanne has sufficient time to fulfil her duties as a director of the Company and Chair of the Remuneration Committee that this is evidenced by her excellent attendance record at meetings.\nTHE OPERATION OF THE BOARD The Board of Directors meets at least six times a year and more often if required. The table below sets out the Directors’ attendance at Board and Committee meetings from 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2024.\nPOLLEN STREET 72 Annual Report and Accounts 2024",

By identifying the important elements of the Company’s dynamic and driven culture, the Directors assess and monitor it and ensure that it remains aligned with the Company’s purpose, values and strategy. The Board promotes a culture of openness and debate.\nThe Company operates around five core values; expert, caring, enterprising, progressive and driven. We aim to be a purpose-led asset manager delivering consistent returns and sustainable growth for our investors and stakeholders alongside positive impact for our people, portfolio companies and wider society. The culture of the Board is considered as part of the annual review of the board effectiveness and the strategy review processes. During the year the Company has implemented various initiatives to further develop and embed the culture in the Company, more details can be found on page 49 in the Strategic Report.\nCHAIR AND SENIOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR AND DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES The Chair, Robert Sharpe, considers himself to have sufficient time to spend on the affairs of the Company.\nMr Sharpe has no significant commitments other than those disclosed in his biography on page 64.\nThe SID, Jim Coyle, considers himself to have sufficient time to spend on the affairs of the Company.\nMr Coyle has no significant commitments other than those disclosed in his biography on page 64.\nThe following sets out the division of responsibilities between the Chair and the SID.\nRole of the Chair The Chair leads the Board and is responsible for its overall effectiveness in directing the Company.\nThe Chair:\n• demonstrates objective judgement; • promotes a culture of openness and debate; • facilitates constructive Board relations and the effective contribution of all Non-Executive Directors; • ensures appropriate delegation of authority from the Board to executive management; • ensures that Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information; • in addition to formal general meetings, offers regular engagement with major shareholders in order to understand their views on governance and performance; • ensures that the Board as a whole has a clear understanding of the views of shareholders; • develops a productive working relationship with the Chief Executive Officer, providing support and advice, while respecting executive responsibility; and • acts on the results of the annual evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors by recognising the strengths and addressing any weaknesses of the Board.\nRole of the Senior Independent Director The role of the SID is to provide a sounding board to the Chair and to serve as an intermediary for the other Directors and shareholders. Led by the SID, the Non-Executive directors meet without the Chair present at least annually to appraise the Chair’s performance, and on other occasions as necessary.\nThe SID is also available to meet with shareholders to provide a channel for any shareholder concerns with the Chair.\nINDEPENDENCE OF DIRECTORS Robert Sharpe, Jim Coyle, Richard Rowney and Joanne Lake were considered, on appointment, to be free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of his or her independent judgement and have remained so since. The Board noted that Joanne Lake was the sole shareholder of the Company prior to 24 January 2024 for administrative purposes but did not consider this to impact on her independence and the Board is of the view that there are no relationships or circumstances relating to the Company that are likely to affect the judgement of any of the independent Directors.\nCare will be taken at all times to ensure that the Board is composed of members who, as a whole, have the required knowledge, abilities and experience to properly fulfil their role and are sufficiently independent.\nDECISION-MAKING The importance of the stakeholder considerations, in the context of decision making, is taken into account at every Board and Committee meeting.\nAll discussions involve careful considerations of the longer-term consequences of any decisions and their implications for stakeholders.\nPOLLEN STREET 74 Annual Report and Accounts 2024",

      "text": "The Board adopts the following general approach in its discussions and decision-making:\n• The papers for each meeting include a reminder of Directors’ Section 172 duties and the Group’s key stakeholders. The Chair of the Board and committee chairs ensure that the ensuing discussions are properly informed by all relevant Section 172 matters.\n• The Board assesses and approves the Group’s purpose, values and strategy, ensures the strategy is aligned with the culture, and is responsible for promoting those values and culture.\n• The Board regularly monitors progress on the implementation of the strategy and associated business plan, and reviews both annually to ensure they remain appropriate.\n• Details of how the Board and its committees engage with our key stakeholders can be found on page 79 of this Corporate Governance Statement.\n• The Board and its committees consider the potential consequences of its decisions in the short, medium and long term. It ensures that the Group’s risk management processes identify any resulting risks to the business and its stakeholders, and have plans to appropriately address these risks.\nBOARD PERFORMANCE REVIEW The Board Performance Review conducted in 2024 was an internal review lead by the Company Secretary, however the Chair and Board note that the Company should conduct an external Board Performance Review every 3 years and therefore intends to conduct an external review no later than 2026.\nThe performance of the Board and its Committees and Directors as well as the independence of the Directors was evaluated by means of a tailored questionnaire during 2024. The questionnaire was completed by all Board members. It examined the effectiveness of the Board in the following areas:\n• behaviours and dynamics; • purpose and strategy; • stakeholder relationships; • governance; and • priorities for change.\nThe independence of the Directors and their ability to commit sufficient time to the Company’s activities was considered as part of the evaluation process.\nDirectors also completed a self-evaluation and an appraisal of the Chair. The responses to the Board Performance Review were anonymised and collated by the Company Secretary and a report provided to the Nomination Committee in the first instance and then reviewed by each committee and the Board.\nOverall, the results showed that the Board was working well and that all Directors continue to make positive contributions. The Directors felt that there was an appropriate balance of knowledge, skills, and specific sector experience on the Board and there were no significant concerns among the Directors about the Board’s effectiveness.\nAreas identified for further consideration included, continuing to improve information flow between the Company, the Board and committees to ensure coverage of key issues, further work on strategy with a full strategy day to be added to the annual calendar, further consideration to be given to the Company’s culture and implementation of the culture policy and to develop further mechanisms to effectively obtain the views of wider stakeholders.\nIt was also acknowledged that increased diversity on the Board was required and that this was being addressed as part of succession planning and that new board members with experience in private equity and asset management would be beneficial.\nThe SID led the appraisal of the Chair and received all completed questionnaires and subsequently met with all Directors excluding the Chair to discuss the results.\nThe comments received from this meeting were then discussed with the Chair.\nThe Chair received all Director self-appraisal forms, and these were discussed with the other Directors to provide an opportunity for Directors to raise any matters of concern. All Directors were deemed to be fulfilling their duties effectively, to have the skills and experience relevant to the leadership and direction of the Company and to be making a significant contribution to the Board.\nThe Directors were satisfied with progress against actions arising from the 2023 evaluation including continuing to closely monitor and observe the Company’s risk and control systems; maintaining oversight of business performance and resilience whilst considering further opportunities for sustainable growth and updating processes and information regarding the Group following the Reorganisation.\nPOLLEN STREET 75 Corporate Governance Report",

The process did not identify any material gaps in knowledge or experience on the Board as a whole but it identified some areas of concentration and where it would be appropriate for whole Board training to be sought to ensure our knowledge is kept up to date. The process also prompted discussions on key considerations for the Board when appointing new Directors to support the implementation of the Company’s future strategy.\nTRAINING The Company Secretary, the Company’s legal advisers and the management team offer a comprehensive induction programme to new Directors to ensure they have the necessary knowledge of the Group, their duties and obligations as Directors and other matters as may be relevant from time to time. Board members are encouraged to keep up to date and attend training courses on matters that are directly relevant to their involvement with the Company.\nThe Company Secretary provides relevant governance updates at each board meeting, and has proposed a training programme for the Directors, which covers matters including the UK Listing Rules and the new “failure to prevent fraud” offence.\nBOARD APPOINTMENT, ELECTION & TENURE The rules concerning the appointment and replacement of Directors are contained in the Company’s Articles of Incorporation and The Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008 as amended.\nDuring the year Robert Sharpe and Jim Coyle reached their 9 years tenure anniversary. Therefore, the Company has undertaken a recruitment process for a new Chair and new Senior Independent Director and Audit Committee Chair.\nAs the search for a new Chair is ongoing, Mr Sharpe remains as Chair for the time being and has exceeded his 9-year tenure but this is not seen as an impediment to the Company, and it is appropriate for Mr Sharpe to remain in his position until a new chair is found. Once a new chair is appointed the search for a replacement for Mr Coyle will commence. However, given the recent changes regarding the CFO and wider finance team in 2024, the Board is considering the appropriateness of Mr Coyle remaining in his position as audit chair for an additional year to assist with continuity. The Board is also cognisant of ensuring retention of knowledge and note that the Chair and SID departing in the same year would not necessarily be in the best interest of the Company.\nNone of the other Directors consider length of service as an impediment to independence or good judgement but, if they felt that this had become the case, the relevant Director would stand down.\nThe Board considers that all of the current Directors contribute effectively to the operation of the Board and the strategy of the Company.\nDIRECTORS’ SUCCESSION PLAN The Board is aware of the need to consider Board tenure, independence and ensure continuity and a smooth transition of Directors and maintenance of an appropriate balance of skills, experience and diversity at all times and during the year the Nomination Committee has reviewed the Board Succession Policy and with Mr Sharpe and Mr Coyle reaching their 9 year tenure the future needs of the Company and structure of the Board have been at the forefront of Nomination Committee discussions. The Company used Per Ardua Associates Limited (“Per Ardua Associates”) to assist with the search for a new chair and on their appointment they were asked to provide a shortlist of diverse candidates.\nThe initial intention was for Mr Coyle to step down at the AGM and his replacement appointed at the 2025 AGM. However, due to the extended timings for a search for a new Chair, an option is for Mr Coyle to remain on the Board during 2025 and to step down no later than the AGM in 2026. Thus, enabling the new Chair to be involved in the appointment process and ensure continuity of knowledge.\nFollowing the departure of Lucy Tilley in October 2024, Crispin Goldsmith has been appointed as CFO, but has not been appointed as an executive director.\nPOLLEN STREET 76 Annual Report and Accounts 2024",

Directors are not able to vote in respect of any contract, arrangement or transaction in which they have a material interest, and, in such circumstances, they are not counted in the quorum at the relevant Board meeting. A process has been developed to identify any of the Directors’ potential or actual conflicts of interest. This includes declaring any potential new conflicts before the start of each Board meeting.\nA schedule is maintained of each Director’s potential conflicts of interest.\nBOARD DIVERSITY The Board is comprised of a mixture of individuals that have an appropriate balance of skills and experience to meet the needs of the Company and to date appointments are made first and foremost on the basis of merit and taking into account the recognised benefits of all types of diversity.\nThe Board acknowledges the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) Listing Rules that set positive diversity targets and build on the recommendations from the Hampton-Alexander Review on gender diversity on boards and the Parker Review regarding ethnic representation on boards. The Board supports the recommendation to have greater female and ethnic representation and wider diversity on the Board and includes this as a key consideration in its succession planning and recruitment of new directors. The Group maintains the following targets:\n• at least 40 per cent of individuals on the Board to be women; • at least one senior Board position to be held by a woman; and • at least one individual on the Board to be from a minority ethnic background.\nAs detailed in the table below, throughout 2024 the Company has met targets two and three, with target one not being met due to the previous CFO’s unplanned departure.\nFollowing the Company’s appointment to the FTSE 250 the Board will continue to focus on prioritising diversity at all levels of the Company.\nThe following tables show the gender diversity and the ethnic diversity of the Board as at 31 December 2024.\nNumber of Board members Percentage of the Board Number of senior positions on the Board (CEO, SID and Chair) Number in executive management Percentage of executive management Men 4 67% 2 - 0% Women 2 33% 1 1 100% Not specified/ prefer not to say - - - - - POLLEN STREET 77 Corporate Governance Report",

      "text": "Issue considered How the Committee gained assurance Risk of misappropriation of assets and ownership of investments The Audit Committee has reviewed key controls over the assets of the Group over the course of 2024. The Board has put in place procedures to ensure that investments can only be made to the extent that the appropriate contractual and legal arrangements are in place to protect the Group’s assets.\nRisk on valuations of Investment Assets held at fair value The Audit Committee received presentations in 2024 from the management team including deep dives on selected investments. After challenging the assumptions, the Committee concluded that the valuations held were reasonable.\nAccounting for carried interest The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the accounting and presentation of carried interest, which required a number of estimates and judgements which are explained in Note 14. Whilst IFRS does not prescriptively lay out the accounting treatment for carried interest, the Audit Committee is satisfied that the IFRS principles and framework have been applied consistently in the estimates and judgements.\nThe risk of material misstatement of expected credit losses under IFRS 9 Financial instruments The Audit Committee view estimating expected credit losses as a key accounting estimate for the Group. As in previous years, the Committee received presentations from the management team explaining key judgement areas, such as consistency of approach and the Group’s business mix. After challenging the assumptions, the Committee concluded that the provisioning approach and key judgements were reasonable.\nThe Committee has carefully challenged a number of the assumptions underpinning reporting under IFRS 9. The impact of these matters are described in the Strategic Report on pages 82 to 83.\nGoodwill impairment assessment The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the goodwill impairment assessment prepared by management, which included a robust value-in-use valuation of goodwill as at 31 December 2024. This paper outlined key assumptions, such as future income projections, discount rates, and long-term growth rates, all of which were subjected to sensitivity analyses to test the resilience of the valuation. The Committee challenged these assumptions and reviewed the results of stress testing, which demonstrated significant headroom above the carrying amount of goodwill even under stringent scenarios. Based on this comprehensive review and the significant headroom identified in the valuation, the Committee concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill was reasonable and supported by sound financial analyses.\nGoing concern and viability statement The Audit Committee reviewed a paper from the management team in support of the going concern basis and the longer-term viability of the Group. The Committee noted the stability of the Group’s business model, its successful track record, the Group’s three-year financial projections and the results of internal stress testing, and concluded this provided sufficient evidence to support the Board’s viability statement set out on page 61. The Committee will continue to monitor this area closely given the macroeconomic uncertainty described in the Strategic Report.\nFair, balanced and understandable The approach taken by the Committee in determining whether the Annual Report is, when taken as a whole, fair, balanced and understandable, is described in greater detail in this Audit Committee report.\nPOLLEN STREET 84 Annual Report and Accounts 2024",

This is the fourth year that Claire Sandford has represented PwC, with her five-year term ending after the year ended 31 December 2025 audit. Her successor has been appointed and will commence their tenure as the individual who acts on behalf of PwC as the Chartered Accountants and Recognised Auditors for the year ending 31 December 2026.\nThe audit and non-audit fees for the year under review can be found in Note 5 to the financial statements.\nNON-AUDIT SERVICES In relation to non-audit services, the Audit Committee has reviewed and implemented a policy on the engagement of the auditors to supply non-audit services and this is reviewed on an annual basis.\nAll requests or applications for other services to be provided by the auditors over a threshold are submitted to the Audit Committee and will include a description of the services to be rendered and an anticipated cost. The Audit Committee will review the scope and size of any such services provided and any consequent impact upon the auditors’ independence.\nThe Group’s policy follows the requirements of the Financial Reporting Council’s Revised Ethical Standard for Auditors published in December 2024.\nThe policy specifies a number of prohibited services which it is not permitted for the auditors to provide under the revised Ethical Standard.\nEXTERNAL AUDIT INDEPENDENCE The Committee has undertaken a formal assessment of PwC’s independence, which included a review of:\n•\t a report from PwC describing its arrangements to identify, report and manage any conflicts of interest; •\t its policies and procedures for maintaining independence and monitoring compliance with relevant requirements; and •\t the value and type of non-audit services provided by PwC.\nThe Audit Committee monitors the auditors’ objectivity and independence on an ongoing basis.\nIn determining PwC’s independence, the Audit Committee has assessed all relationships with PwC and received confirmation from PwC that it is independent and that no issues of conflicts arose during the year. The Audit Committee is therefore satisfied that PwC is independent.\nEXTERNAL AUDIT EFFECTIVENESS The Audit Committee monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the external audit process on an annual basis and makes recommendations to the Board on its reappointment, remuneration and terms of engagement of the auditors. Over the reporting period, the Audit Committee reviewed management’s proposed judgements. The Committee asked the auditor to review key areas and to ensure that they were challenging management’s judgement with appropriate professional scepticism. Key areas included new accounting policies required for the Reorganisation, the valuation of Investment Assets held fair value through profit or loss, accounting for carried interest and expected credit losses under IFRS 9.\nEach item was reviewed in turn with the auditor to confirm that they were applying professional scepticism. Further disclosure on the challenges provided and the audit work performed is provided in the independent auditors’ report on page 110.\nIn addition, the chair of the Audit Committee met with the audit partner and assessed PwC’s performance to date. The review involved an examination of the auditors’ remuneration, the quality of its work including the quality of the audit report, the quality of the audit partner and audit team, the expertise of the audit firm and the resources available to it, the identification of audit risk, the planning and execution of the audit and the terms of engagement.\nThe Audit Committee has direct access to the Group’s auditors and provides a forum through which the auditors’ report to the Board. Representatives of PwC regularly attend meetings of the Audit Committee.\nAUDIT TENDER The audit was put out to competitive tender during the year under review and as part of this we established clear objectives and selection criteria for the new auditor appointment. The invitation to tender was sent to both “Big 4” and non “Big 4” firms, in order to ensure a wide range of audit firms were considered.\nIn August 2024, four audit firms were invited to take part in the tender and PwC, the incumbent auditor at the time, was also considered as a participant.\nComprehensive information about the Group was provided to the candidates through secure data POLLEN STREET 85 Corporate Governance Report",

Two of the firms responded that, due to varying reasons but largely in relation to capacity and conflicts, they were unable to take part in the tender at that time. Following discussions and review of the submitted tender documents from those firms participating in tendering, the Audit Committee received a presentation from the prospective firms. Further to the presentation and discussions held, the audit committee gave consideration to the technical expertise, cultural fit, the benefits of continuity at a time of change in the finance team and the level of experience of the team, the audit fee and their independence and objectivity.\nAs such, the Audit Committee recommended PwC be reappointed as Auditor to the Board in December 2024 subject to shareholder approval at the upcoming Annual General Meeting.\nWhilst not governed by the requirements of the Statutory Audit Services Order 2014, issued by the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA Order”), a voluntary audit tender and rotation in line with CMA Order will be carried out at least every ten years.\nThe Company will therefore carry out a rotation and tender no later than in respect of the financial year ending 31 December 2036.\n2024 February Audit Committee noted that as the Company was Guernsey incorporated and adhered to Guernsey crown dependency audit rules, UK audit tender rotation requirements were not applicable to the Company.

The Committee also reviewed copies of the 2024 Annual Report and Accounts during the drafting process to ensure key messages and themes being followed throughout the Annual Report and Accounts were aligned with the Company’s position, performance and strategy intentions, and that the narrative in the report and financial statements was consistent throughout.\nPOLLEN STREET 86 Annual Report and Accounts 2024",

Our people are our most valuable asset, and it is this belief that governs the way in which we conduct our business and how we recognise, celebrate and reward our people.\nAt Pollen Street we truly value our people and their differences. It is our different experiences, backgrounds, expertise and identities that promote an environment of entrepreneurial and progressive thinking. We therefore consider a diverse and inclusive workforce critical to our success. Irrespective of how our people identify, where they come from, where they went to school or any other factor that differentiates them, they can truly thrive at Pollen Street.\nWe take a very considered approach to attracting and recruiting exceptional talent, people who embody our values and high performing culture. We have built a comprehensive development curriculum for our employees, something that remains a continuous priority to ensure every employee can thrive and have a challenging and rewarding career at Pollen Street.\nWe have a driven, entrepreneurial culture underpinned by meritocracy and effective risk management and our remuneration structures reflect this. Alongside marketcompetitive salaries and a comprehensive benefits package, discretionary annual bonuses are awarded based on individual performance and the performance of the Group.\nWe will continue to review our approach to remuneration to ensure we build upon our pay-for-performance culture, and we maintain our strong levels of employee engagement.\nThe Committee uses a range of information to ensure that remuneration is appropriate across the Group. This includes internal and external benchmarking such as salary surveys, the CEO Pay Ratio, and the Gender Pay Gap. There is further disclosure on the CEO Pay Ratio and the Gender Pay Gap in the Annual Report on Remuneration.\nSeparately, certain employees of the Group participate in carried interest schemes linked solely to the fund performance. This is not considered to be remuneration; carried interest represents a separate relationship between the fund investors and the relevant employees and is an investment requiring the individuals to put their own capital at risk.\nSUMMARY OF DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY Our Directors’ Remuneration Policy is designed to promote the delivery of sustainable long-term performance and growth through the long-term nature of the incentive plans (annual bonuses, bonus deferral and the Long-Term Incentive Plan), the variety of performance measures used, and the balanced scorecard approach to target-setting and performance assessment.\nExecutive Directors receive a combination of base salary, pension contributions, annual bonus and other benefits. The annual bonus is based on a set of financial and non-financial performance objectives. Each Executive Director has a target and maximum opportunity level based upon performance criteria. The criteria are reinforced by malus and DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT As Chair of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nPOLLEN STREET 94 Annual Report and Accounts 2024",

The Remuneration Committee consulted with major shareholders on the proposed policy prior to its approval at the general meeting held on 1 June 2022, with strong support from our shareholders. On 30 September 2022, the date of completion of the Combination, the Executive Directors were appointed to the Board of Pollen Street Limited and the Remuneration Committee took on oversight responsibility for remuneration across the newly combined Group. The Directors’ Remuneration Policy takes into account market best practice, industry specific considerations, guidelines from UK institutional shareholders and advisory bodies and reflects best practice within our regulatory framework.\nThe full Directors’ Remuneration Policy may be found on the Company’s website in the circular dated 10 May 2022 at www.pollenstreetgroup.com/ shareholders.\nREMUNERATION PAYABLE TO DIRECTORS IN RESPECT OF 2024 The Annual Report on Remuneration sets out the remuneration outcomes for the Directors for the year.\nThe Executive Directors received a combination of salary, benefits, pension contributions and bonus.\nThe base salary for the Executive Directors remained unchanged from the previous financial year and is disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration. The bonus award was set based on a set of performance criteria. These criteria were set in advance of the period using a range of measures of the financial results of the business. They include growing AuM, delivering EBITDA, ensuring risk management and compliance are effective and delivering ESG outcomes. This ensures that selective investing and careful portfolio management, undertaken within the necessary risk and compliance framework are considered when measuring performance.\nFurthermore, our commitment to ESG, including our continued focus on sustainability, DEI and culture are also carefully assessed. This approach reflects the Board’s strong focus on not only the financial performance of the Group but also the way in which business is conducted, and the role the Company plays from an environmental, social and governance perspective. Performance against these criteria was ahead of target for 2024.\nAlthough the Group’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) was approved by shareholders at the general meeting on 1 June 2022, as explained in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, the Company will not make any awards under the LTIP to the Executive Directors or other employees for a period of two years from completion of the Combination and therefore no LTIP awards were granted to the Executive Directors in 2023 or 2024.\nThe Chair of the Board receives a fixed fee at a rate equivalent to £170,000 per annum. The other Non-Executive Directors receive base fees of £65,000 per annum plus £10,000 per annum for each committee chair plus £10,000 per annum for the Senior Independent Director. The fees were set following a benchmarking exercise of Non-Executive Director fees for comparable businesses conducted by Aon and the changes made in 2022 and 2023 were made in consideration of the next few years and therefore further changes were not required and the remuneration was in line with market rates. The Board noted that during the recruitment process of the new chair the fees were self tested and it was concluded that the remuneration structure remained competitive and appropriate for attracting and retaining high-calibre Non-Executive Directors. The Annual Report on Remuneration sets out in full the remuneration for Directors in respect of 2024 (see pages 98 to 107).\nMEMBERSHIP The Remuneration Committee comprises of Joanne Lake, Robert Sharpe, Jim Coyle and Richard Rowney as four independent Non-Executive Directors, all of whom have remuneration experience due to the senior positions they hold or have held in other listed or large organisations. It is chaired by Joanne Lake. The members’ biographies can be found on page 64 to 65.\nThe Group’s CEO is not a member of the Remuneration Committee but attends meetings at the invitation of the Chair of the Committee together with the Group’s Partner responsible for remuneration as considered necessary. An individual is not present when the Remuneration Committee is discussing the individual’s remuneration.\nPOLLEN STREET 95 Corporate Governance Report",

The Executive Committee and Remuneration Committee were working to increase their dialogue and ensure there was greater reporting on remuneration and people matters to the Remuneration Committee. Board effectiveness will continue to be a priority for the Board and our approach to evaluating effectiveness will continue to evolve in accordance with our strategic objectives.\nDetails of the process followed and outcomes are set out in the Board Performance Review section of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 75.\nTERMS OF REFERENCE The Remuneration Committee has formal terms of reference which are available from the Company Secretary and the Company website.

      "text": "BUSINESS PERFORMANCE & EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION The Remuneration Committee set a range of stretching targets for the Executive Directors to ensure that variable remuneration is appropriately linked to business performance. The targets take into account remuneration practices across the sector as well as Pollen Street’s remuneration of all employees.\nPollen Street has a robust performance management process in place for its employees that supports a pay-for-performance culture for all staff. The Executive Director’s balanced scorecard approach includes financial metrics and strategic non-financial objectives, as set by the Remuneration Committee, which measure the overall performance of the business to ensure variable remuneration clearly links to business performance. These measures are discussed with employees as part of the Group’s objective setting process to ensure alignment between the remuneration of the Executive Directors and remuneration across the Group and employees are aware that the same process is applied to Executive Directors’ pay. Furthermore, to promote transparency and to ensure remuneration practices remain well informed, the Group whilst not obligated to do so elects to undertake and publish gender pay gap reporting and CEO pay ratio information.\nThe following table and notes summarise the applicable performance criteria, how performance is measured, the applicable weighting for each criteria and the performance outcome for the year ended 31 December 2024:\nKPI Threshold Target Stretch 2024 Outcome Weighting EBITDA £45 million £50 million £55 million £57.5 million 40% Average Fee-Paying AuM £3.0 billion £3.6 billion £4.2 billion £3.69 billion 40% Risk & ESG Threshold On Target Ahead of Target Ahead of Target 20% The following table summarises the applicable performance criteria for the year ended 31 December 2023:\nKPI Threshold Target Stretch 2023 Outcome Weighting EBITDA £40 million £44 million £48 million £45.1 million 40% Average Fee-Paying AuM £2.6 billion £2.9 billion £3.2 billion £2.95 billion 40% Risk & ESG Threshold On Target Ahead of Target On Target 20% The criteria operated as intended and the Remuneration Committee did not adjust the performance targets during the year or override any of the outcomes except as set out below.\nEBITDA Performance Measurement EBITDA means the Group’s profit according to IFRS reporting standards before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, adjusted to exclude exceptional items and start-up losses of the US business, but including the full costs of the office leases despite these costs being reported as depreciation of a right-of-use asset and associated financing costs under IFRS 16.\nThe target was set to be in line with the market consensus for results for the Group. The stretch target is set to be approximately 10 per cent above target; similarly, the threshold is set to be approximately 10 per cent below the target.\nPOLLEN STREET 100 Annual Report and Accounts 2024",

External and internal audits for the period have not raised any material adverse findings. All internal audit findings have been successfully closed or are scheduled for resolution within expected timeframes and these open actions are all classified as minor findings. There were no cyber incidents resulting in any loss to the firm or an investor. As at 31 December 2024, 100% of Private Equity counterparties and 95% of Private Credit counterparties have provided metrics for the 2023 reporting period.

Pollen Street is also very proud to maintain carbon neutral status.\nRisk and ESG performance is considered to be ahead of expectations, however has not achieved all of the criteria for the stretch target. A performance factor of 150 per cent is therefore applied to this measure.\nWEIGHTING Each Executive Director bonus award is calculated by weighting together the performance against each KPI, with performance at the ”threshold” level corresponding to a nil bonus, performance at the “target” level corresponding to a bonus at 100 per cent of the Executive Director’s salary, performance at the “stretch” level corresponding to 200 per cent of the Executive Director’s salary and performance between these levels calculated on a pro rata basis.\nIn accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, annual bonuses will be paid in part upfront in cash, with 35 per cent of any bonus deferred. Accordingly for the year ended 31 December 2024, £227,500 of the bonus awarded to Lindsey McMurray will be deferred.\nDeferred awards may be used to acquire shares in Pollen Street Group Limited, or fund commitments into Pollen Street managed funds and are subject to malus and clawback provisions.\nPOLLEN STREET 101 Corporate Governance Report",

Further information is available on the Company’s website in the circular dated 10 May 2022.\nClarity - The Directors’ Remuneration Policy is as clear as possible and full details are described in straightforward concise terms to shareholders and the workforce.\nSimplicity - Remuneration structures are as simple as possible and aligned to the Private Equity and alternative investments sector, whilst at the same time incorporating the necessary structural features appropriate for a listed company to ensure a strong alignment to performance and strategy and minimising the risk of rewarding failure.\nRisk - The Directors’ Remuneration Policy has been shaped to discourage inappropriate risk-taking through a weighting of incentive pay towards long term incentives, the balance between financial and nonfinancial measures in the relevant employee share plans and in employment and post-employment shareholding requirements.\nPredictability - The Remuneration Committee maintains clear caps on incentive opportunities and uses its available discretion if necessary.\nProportionality - There is an industry-appropriate balance between fixed pay and variable pay, and incentive pay is weighted to sustainable longterm performance. Incentive plans are subject to performance targets that consider both financial and non-financial performance linked to strategy, and outcomes will not reward poor performance.\nAlignment to culture - The Remuneration Committee considers the Company’s culture and wider workforce policies when shaping and developing Executive Director remuneration policies to ensure that there is coherence across the organisation. There is a strong emphasis on the fairness of remuneration outcomes across the workforce.\nAPPROVAL This report was approved by the Remuneration Committee on 24 March 2025.\nJoanne Lake Chair of the Remuneration Committee 24 March 2025 POLLEN STREET 107 Corporate Governance Report",

We performed a full scope audit of Pollen Street Limited and for three other components, specific audit procedures were performed over selected significant account balances.\nKey audit matters •  Valuation of the allowance for expected credit losses on Credit Assets at amortised cost (Group) •  Valuation of Equity Assets and Carried interest assets at fair value (Group) •  Goodwill (Group) •  Investments in subsidiaries (Company) Materiality •  Overall Group materiality: £2,800,000 based on 5% of profit before tax.\n•  Overall Company materiality: £6,000,000 based on 1% of total assets.\n•  Performance materiality: £2,100,000 (Group) and £4,500,000 (Company).\nThe scope of our audit As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.\nKey audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nThis is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.\nValuation of the allowance for expected credit losses on credit assets at amortised cost, valuation of equity assets and carried interest assets at fair value, goodwill and investments in subsidiaries are new key audit matters this year. Accuracy and completeness of administration costs, which was a key audit matter last year, is no longer included because of the change in activities and audit risks of the Group and Company due to the reorganisation.\nPOLLEN STREET 111 Corporate Governance Report",

      "text": "Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Valuation of the allowance for expected credit losses on Credit Assets at amortised cost (Group) Credit Assets recorded at amortised cost amounted to £309,423,000 for the Group as at 31 December 2024 (2023: £444,490,000). The amount is net of the allowance for expected credit losses (“ECL”) in accordance with IFRS 9 of £8,904,000 (2023: £8,311,000).\nDetermining ECL involves judgement and is subject to a high degree of estimation uncertainty. Various assumptions are required when estimating ECL.\nThe significant assumptions that we focused on in our audit included those for which variations had the most significant impact on ECL. We have determined that the significant assumptions relate to the loss given default (“LGD”) for the structured portfolios. LGD is primarily determined by assumptions over collateral value including estimates of discounts, time to repossession and recovery costs.\nRefer to Report of the Audit Committee ‘Significant accounting matters’; Note 2 Material accounting policies ‘Expected credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost’; Note 3 Significant accounting estimates and judgements ‘Expected credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost’; and Note 9 Credit Assets at amortised cost.\nWe understood and evaluated the design of controls over the estimation of ECLs over Credit Assets at amortised cost.\nWe understood and assessed the ECL methodology and assumptions applied by the Group by reference to accounting standards and industry practice and tested the techniques used in estimating the ECL. We performed substantive testing over the following, with the assistance of our credit specialists:\n•  We critically assessed the appropriateness of the significant assumptions and methodologies used for models and judgemental adjustments, including the selection of key parameters such as probabilities of default, LGD and the selection of macroeconomic scenarios.\n•  We performed analysis to understand the sensitivity of the ECL to reasonable changes in the LGD assumptions.\n•  On a sample basis, for structured lending exposures we obtained an understanding of the underlying collateral type and projected cash flows on which the ECL assessment is based. We compared the cash flows and collateral to management’s loan monitoring conclusions and obtained supporting information, such as third party agreed upon procedures reports on underlying collateral.\n•  We further considered whether the judgements made in selecting the significant assumptions would give rise to indicators of possible management bias.\nWe evaluated and tested the disclosures over credit assets recorded at amortised cost made in the financial statements.\nBased on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, we found management’s judgements used in the determination of the ECLs to be materially compliant with the requirements of UK‑adopted international accounting standards.\nPOLLEN STREET 112 POLLEN STREET 112 Annual Report and Accounts 2024",

We assessed the appropriateness of the comparable peer sets used by management and independently verified peer company trading multiples.\n•  For a sample of equity asset valuations based on net assets values, we agreed the net asset values used to calculate the fair value to audited financial statements and inspected those financial statements to assess whether the use of net assets as a basis for fair value was appropriate. Where adjustments to net asset values were applied, we obtained corroborating information, including comparison to secondary market transactions.\n•  For a sample of carried interest assets, with the assistance of our valuation experts we tested the valuation model methodology and understood the impact of model limitations, and we performed a sensitivity analysis to test the impact of reasonable alternative input assumptions on the valuation.\n•  For a sample of carried interest assets, we obtained the fund and carried interest partnership agreements and tested the calculation to ensure that carried interest was allocated to the Group appropriately.\nWe further considered whether the judgements made in selecting the significant assumptions would give rise to indicators of possible management bias.\nWe evaluated and tested the disclosures over equity assets and carried interest assets made in the financial statements.\nBased on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, we found management’s judgements used in the valuation of equity assets and carried interest assets at fair value to be materially compliant with the requirements of UK-adopted international accounting standards.\nPOLLEN STREET 113 Corporate Governance Report",

      "text": "Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Goodwill (Group) On 30 September 2022, the Group acquired the entire shareholding of Pollen Street Capital Holdings Limited (“PSCH”) via an all share transaction and goodwill was recognised. The goodwill balance was £224,540,000 as at 31 December 2024 (2023: £224,540,000).\nManagement performed an impairment assessment and estimated a recoverable amount using a value in use (‘VIU’) approach. The recoverable amount was in excess of the carrying value and no impairment was recognised as at 31 December 2024.\nThe methodology used to estimate the VIU is dependent on various assumptions, both short-term and long-term in nature.\nThese assumptions, which are subject to estimation uncertainty, are derived from a combination of management’s judgement and market data.\nThe significant assumptions with greater levels of management judgement and for which variations had the most significant impact on the recoverable amount included forecast cash flows of acquired business over 4 years; long term growth rates; and discount rates applied to the cash flow forecasts.\nRefer to Report of the Audit Committee ‘Significant accounting matters’; Note 2 Material accounting policies ‘Goodwill’; Note 3 Significant accounting estimates and judgements ‘Impairment assessment for goodwill’; and Note 13 ‘Goodwill and Intangible assets’.\nWe understood and evaluated the design of controls over determining the recoverable amount of the goodwill balance.\nWe understood and assessed the methodology and inputs used to assess the value in use of Goodwill.\nWe performed substantive testing including the following:\n•  We inspected the model used to estimate the goodwill VIU and recalculated the VIU to confirm the calculations used were accurate.\n•  We challenged the achievability of management’s forecast cash flows by reference to historical performance and the fundraising track record, Board approved forecasts and external consensus forecasts.\n•  With the assistance of our valuation experts, we determined a reasonable range for the discount rate and a reasonable alternative long term growth rate used within the VIU model and compared it to the rates used by management.\n•  We recalculated the sensitivity of the VIU to reasonable variations in significant assumptions.\n•  We further considered whether the judgements made in selecting the significant assumptions would give rise to indicators of possible management bias.\nBased on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, we found the carrying value of the goodwill to be materially compliant with the requirements of UK-adopted international accounting standards.\nInvestments in subsidiaries (Company) The company holds 100 per cent of the share capital of Pollen Street Limited (“PSL”) and Pollen Street Capital Holdings Limited (“PSCHL”) amounting to a total carrying value of £571,269,000 as at 31 December 2024.\nIAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ requires that investments should be assessed for any indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period.\nManagement determined that the net assets of both the subsidiaries were below carrying value. Management performed an impairment assessment and determined the recoverable amount of each subsidiary based on a value in use (‘VIU’) approach. The VIU was determined to be above carrying value for both subsidiaries and therefore no impairment was recognised as at 31 December 2024.\nThe determination of the recoverable amount is based on a number of assumptions that are subjective and judgemental; these include the forecast cash flows, the long-term growth rate and the discount rate applied to the forecast cash flows.\nRefer to Note 2 Material accounting policies ‘Investments in subsidiaries’; and Note 28 ‘Investments in subsidiaries’.\nOur audit procedures comprised the following:\n•  We inspected the model used to estimate the subsidiaries VIU and recalculated the VIU to confirm the calculations used were accurate.\n•  We challenged the achievability of management’s forecast cash flows and long term growth rate by reference to historical performance and the fundraising track record, Board approved forecasts and external consensus forecasts.\n•  We assessed the discount rate by reference to external market consensus.\n•  We assessed the sensitivity of the recoverable amount to reasonable variations in significant assumptions.\nBased on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, we found the carrying value of the investments in subsidiaries to be materially compliant with the requirements of UK-adopted international accounting standards.\nPOLLEN STREET 114 POLLEN STREET 114 Annual Report and Accounts 2024",

      "text": "How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. We performed a risk assessment, giving consideration to relevant external and internal factors, including climate change, economic risks and the Group’s strategy.\nWe also considered our knowledge and experience obtained in prior year audits of the Company and the subsidiaries. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. The Group audit team performed all audit work on the components.\nThe impact of climate risk on our audit As part of our audit we made enquiries of management to understand the extent of the potential impact of climate risk on the financial statements and we remained alert when performing our audit procedures for any indicators of the impact of climate risk. We evaluated and challenged management’s assessment of the impact of climate risk, as set out in the Climate-related risk management - Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) section of the Strategic Report, which includes the potential impact on underlying investments. We read the disclosures in relation to climate risk made in the other information within the Annual Report to ascertain whether the disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge from our audit. Our responsibility over other information is further described in the Reporting on other information section of our report. Our procedures did not identify any material adjustments needed to capture climate impacts on the Group and Company financial statements.\nMateriality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\nFinancial statements - Group Financial statements - Company Overall materiality £2,800,000 £6,000,000 How we determined it 5% of profit before tax 1% of total assets Rationale for benchmark applied We have applied this benchmark (rounded to the nearest hundred thousand) considering the key figures used to measure financial performance and presented in the Annual report are profit based measures, such as total income and operating profit.\nWe have applied this benchmark (rounded to the nearest hundred thousand) which is a generally accepted auditing practice for a company whose primary purpose is that of a holding company.\nPOLLEN STREET 115 Corporate Governance Report",

      "text": "For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between £1,470,000 and £2,660,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.\nWe use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality.\nSpecifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% of overall materiality, amounting to £2,100,000 for the Group financial statements and £4,500,000 for the Company financial statements.\nIn determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.\nWe agreed with those charged with governance that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £140,000 (Group audit) and £300,000 (Company audit) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\nCONCLUSIONS RELATING TO GOING CONCERN Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n•  Performing a risk assessment to identify factors that could impact the going concern basis of accounting.\n•  Obtaining and evaluating management’s going concern assessment.\n•  Understanding and evaluating the Group’s financial forecasts and the Group’s stress testing of the forecast cash flows, including the severity of the stress scenarios that were used.\n•  Validation of year end financial resources such as cash and interest rate borrowings.\n•  Obtaining and evaluating covenants testing.\n•  Evaluating the adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements in relation to going concern.\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\nHowever, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn relation to the directors’ reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\nREPORTING ON OTHER INFORMATION The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information.\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the POLLEN STREET 116 POLLEN STREET 116 Annual Report and Accounts 2024",

Our additional responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance statement as other information are described in the Reporting on other information section of this report.\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n•  The directors’ confirmation that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks; •  The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated; •  The directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements; •  The directors’ explanation as to their assessment of the Group’s and Company’s prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate; and •  The directors’ statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\nOur review of the directors’ statement regarding the longer-term viability of the Group and Company was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statement; checking that the statement is in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering whether the statement is consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.\nIn addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n•  The directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy; •  The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and •  The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the audit committee.\nWe have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when the directors’ statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for review by the auditors.\nPOLLEN STREET 117 Corporate Governance Report",

      "text": "RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.\nBased on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to the Financial Conduct Authority’s UK Listing Rules, and we considered the extent to which noncompliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008 and UK tax legislation. We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to increase revenue and management bias in accounting estimates. Audit procedures performed by the engagement team included:\n•  Discussions with management and the Audit Committee, including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulation and fraud; •  Reviewing Board meeting and other relevant Committee minutes to identify any significant or unusual transactions or other matters that could require further investigation; •  Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in determining significant accounting estimates, in particular in relation to the valuation of equity assets and carried interest assets at fair value, allowance for expected credit losses on amortised cost assets and accounting for goodwill; •  Identifying and testing journal entries meeting specific fraud criteria, including those posted with certain account combinations and posted by unexpected users; •  Obtaining confirmations from third parties to confirm the existence of a sample of balances; and •  Incorporating unpredictability in the selection of the nature, timing and extent of audit procedures performed.\nThere are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.\nPOLLEN STREET 118 POLLEN STREET 118 Annual Report and Accounts 2024",

      "text": "NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Pollen Street Group Limited is a public company limited by shares, incorporated and registered under the laws of Guernsey with registration number 70165. Pollen Street Group Limited is referred to as the “Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, the ‘Group’. The registered office of the Company is:\nMont Crevelt House, Bulwer Avenue, St. Sampson, Guernsey, GY2 4LH. The principal place of business of the Company is 11-12 Hanover Square, London, W1S 1JJ.\nThe Company was established on 24 December 2021. The Company’s purpose was to become the parent company of Pollen Street Limited (“PSL”), previously Pollen Street plc, by way of a scheme of arrangement (the “Scheme”). The Company’s activities until the Scheme came into effect were compliance related. The scheme of arrangement came into effect on 24 January 2024.\nOn 24 January 2024, the Company became the immediate and ultimate parent of Pollen Street Limited by way of a scheme of arrangement pursuant to Part 26 of the UK Companies Act 2006. As part of this, the shares of Pollen Street Limited were delisted and cancelled, and new shares were issued to the Company so that the Company holds 100 per cent of the issued shares in Pollen Street Limited.\nNew shares in the Company were also issued to the former shareholders of Pollen Street Limited on a one-to-one basis and were admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange’s (“LSE”) main market for listed securities.\nOn 14 February 2024, Pollen Street Limited distributed the entire issued share capital of Pollen Street Capital Holdings Limited (“PSCHL”) to the Company referred to as the Distribution. The Scheme and the Distribution are together referred to as the “Reorganisation”.\nThe principal activity of the Group is to act as an alternative asset manager investing within the financial and business services sectors across both Private Equity and Private Credit strategies, as well as holding on-balance sheet investments consisting of both direct investments and investments in funds managed by Pollen Street. The principal activity of the Company is to be the holding company for two 100 per cent owned subsidiaries engaged in these asset management and investment activities.\n1.

      "text": "BASIS OF PREPARATION These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and with the requirements of The Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008, and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). The accounting policies comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and International Financial Reporting Committee as adopted in the UK, including interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standard Committee (“IASC”) that remain in effect.\nThe Reorganisation is a capital reorganisation and has been accounted for using the book-value method. This method applies retrospectively, meaning that the financial statements are restated as if the Reorganisation had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented, i.e. from 1 January 2023.\nThe prior year comparatives are unaudited for Pollen Street Group Limited. They are based on the audited consolidated financial statements for Pollen Street Limited as set out in the Pollen Street Limited Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2023 and the audited Pollen Street Group Limited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 as set out in the Pollen Street Group Limited Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2023. These numbers have been included as comparatives in accordance with the book-value method of accounting for capital reorganisations. Refer to the Capital Reorganisation accounting policy below for more details.\nGOING CONCERN The Directors have reviewed the financial projections of the Group, which show that the Group will be able to generate sufficient cash flows in order to meet its liabilities as they fall due within 12 months from the approval of these financial statements.\nThese financial projections have been performed for the Group under stressed scenarios, and in all cases the Group is able to meet its liabilities as they fall due. For the Investment Company, the stressed scenarios included halting future Investment Asset originations, late repayments of the largest structured facility and individual exposures experience ongoing performance at the worst monthly impact experienced throughout 2023 and 2024. For the Asset Manager, the stressed scenarios included no new funds being raised.\nThe Directors consider these scenarios to be the most relevant risks to the Group’s operations. Finally, the Directors reviewed financial and non-financial covenants in place for all debt facilities within the subsidiaries of the Group with no breaches anticipated, even in the stressed scenario. The Directors are satisfied that the going concern basis remains appropriate for the preparation of the financial statements.\nThe material accounting policies adopted by the Company are set out below and have been consistently applied across periods presented and all values are in pounds.\nADOPTION OF NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards effective for the year ended 31 December 2024 The following new and amended standards do not have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements:\nInternational accounting standards and interpretations Effective date Amendments to IAS 1:\n1 January 2024 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Non-current liabilities with covenants Amendments to IFRS 16:\n1 January 2024 Lease liability in a sale and leaseback Amendments to IAS 7 and 1 January 2024 IFRS 7: Supplier Finance Arrangements 2.

These standards do not have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements, with the exception of IFRS 18:\n‘Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements’ which will impact the presentation and disclosure of financial statements. The Group plans to adopt these, if applicable, when they become effective.\nInternational accounting standards and interpretations Effective date Amendments to IAS 21: Lack 1 January 2025 of Exchangeability Amendments to IFRS 9 and 1 January 2026 IFRS 7: Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments New Accounting Standard 1 January 2027 IFRS 18: ‘Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements’ New Accounting Standard 1 January 2027 IFRS 19: ‘Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures’ ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONSOLIDATION Subsidiaries are investees controlled by the Company.\nThe Company controls an investee if it is exposed to, or has the rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The Company reassesses whether it has control if there are changes to one or more elements of control. The Company does not consider itself to be an investment entity for the purposes of IFRS 10, as it does not hold substantially all of its investments at fair value. Consequently, it consolidates its subsidiaries rather than holding at fair value through profit or loss.\nThe Group also assessed the consolidation requirements for the carried interest partnerships and certain underlying entities of Pollen Street managed funds (“funds”) which the Group holds as investments as explained in the investments in associates section. Refer to Note 28 for further details.\nIn the consolidated financial statements, intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. All entities within the Group have coterminous reporting dates.\nCAPITAL REORGANISATION Capital reorganisations are accounted for using the book-value method. This methodology is used as these transactions do not represent a substantive change in ownership. Instead, they are viewed as a reorganisation of entities within the same group.\nThe Directors consider this method to be the most accurate reflection of the historical financial performance and position of the combining entities following the Reorganisation.\nThis method applies retrospectively, meaning that the financial statements are restated as if the Reorganisation had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented. The assets and liabilities of the combining entities are recognised at their carrying amounts in the financial statements. No adjustments are made to reflect fair values or recognise any new assets or liabilities, except where necessary to align accounting policies.\nAny consideration transferred is recognised at its carrying amount. The difference between the consideration transferred and the carrying amount of the net assets acquired is recognised in equity.\nComparative information is restated to reflect the reorganisation as if it had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented, i.e. 1 January 2023.\nThis ensures consistency and comparability of financial information across periods. Therefore, the prior year comparatives reflect those of the Group when Pollen Street Limited was the ultimate parent of the Group. These numbers were audited as part of the Pollen Street Limited consolidated Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2023.\nRefer to Note 4 for further details.\nINVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES Investments in subsidiaries in the Statement of Financial Position of the Company are recorded at cost less provision for impairments.

The rights are in the form of partnership participations in carried interest partnerships. The Group has 25 per cent of the total interests in these partnerships. The Group has in excess of 20 per cent participation and therefore is considered to have significant influence over the partnerships and the partnerships are considered to be an associate.\nThe Directors also consider any influence that the Group has in the set up of any new carried interest partnerships in order to assess the power to control them. The Group has between 1 per cent and 25 per cent of the total interests in these partnerships. It was determined that the carried interest partnerships were set up on behalf of the fund investors, and that on balance, the Group does not control the carried interest partnerships.\nWhere the Group has in excess of 20 per cent of LP interest in the carried interest partnership, the Group is considered to have significant influence. It was therefore determined that these carried interest partnerships are also accounted for as associates.\nThese carried interest partnerships (including associates and contract assets) are presented in the ‘Carried interest’ line on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position; and income from the carried interest partnerships is presented in the ‘Carried interest and performance fee income’ line on the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.\nThe key judgemental areas for the accounting of carried interest partnerships are set out in Note 3, Significant accounting estimates and judgements.\nFor the underlying entities or funds, the Directors consider the nature of the relationships between the Group, the underlying entities or funds and the investors. The Directors also consider any influence that the Group has in the set up of the underlying entities or funds in order to assess the power to control the underlying entities or funds. It was determined that the underlying entities or funds were set up for the investors, and that on balance, the Group does not control the underlying entities or funds.\nThe Group also holds more than 20 per cent of interest in certain underlying entities or funds. The Group elects to hold these investments in associates at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (“FVTPL”). This treatment is permitted by IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, which permits investments held by entities that are venture capital organisations, mutual funds or similar entities to be excluded from its measurement methodology requirements where those investments are designated, upon initial recognition, as at FVTPL and accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9. These underlying entities or funds are presented in the ‘Investment Assets held at fair value through profit or loss’ line on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\nChanges in fair value of these entities or funds are presented in the ‘Gains on Investment Assets held at fair value’ on the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.\nDetails of how the Group classifies and measures assets at FVTPL are in the classification and measurement section on page 133.\nBUSINESS MODEL ASSESSMENT The Group assesses the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level in order to generate cash flows because this best reflects the way the business is managed. That is, whether the Group’s objective is solely to collect the contractual cash flows from the assets or is to collect both the contractual cash flows and cash flows arising from the sale of assets. If neither of these are applicable, then the financial assets are classified as part of the other business model and measured at FVTPL.\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2024 POLLEN STREET 132",

      "text": "The assessment includes:\n•\t the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice, including whether the strategy focuses on earning contractual interest revenue, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of assets; •\t past experience on how the cash flows for these assets were collected; •\t how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported; •\t the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and how those risks are managed; and •\t the frequency, volume and timing of deployment in prior years, the reasons for such deployment and expectations about future deployment activity.\nHowever, information about deployment activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cashflows are realised.\nASSESSMENT OF WHETHER CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS ARE SOLELY PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST For the purposes of this assessment, “principal” is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. “Interest” is defined as consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a reasonable profit margin.\nIn assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the contractual terms of the instrument are considered.\nThis includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment the following features are considered:\n•\t contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows; •\t leverage features; •\t prepayment and extension terms; •\t terms that limit the Group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets, e.g. non-recourse asset arrangements; and •\t features that modify consideration for the time value of money, e.g. periodic reset of interest rates.\nCLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group shall offset financial assets and financial liabilities if it has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and interests and intends to settle on a net basis.\nFinancial assets and liabilities are derecognised when the Group settles its obligations relating to the instrument.\nCLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT - FINANCIAL ASSETS IFRS 9 contains a classification and measurement approach for debt instruments that reflects the business model in which assets are managed and their cash flow characteristics. This is a principle-based approach and applies one classification approach for all types of debt instruments. For debt instruments, two criteria are used to determine how financial assets are classified and measured:\n• \t the entity’s business model (i.e. how an entity manages its debt Instruments in order to generate cash flows by collecting contractual cash flows, selling financial assets or both); and •\t the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset (i.e. whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest).\nA debt instrument is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n(a) it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and (b) its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\nFinancial Statements POLLEN STREET 133",

      "text": "IFRS 9 details the classification and measurement approach for assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”) if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n(a) it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and (b) its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\nEquity instruments and derivatives are measured at FVTPL, unless they are not held for trading purposes, in which case an irrevocable election can be made on initial recognition to measure them at FVOCI with no subsequent reclassification to profit or loss. This election is made on an investment by investment basis.\nAll financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL.\nAll equity positions are measured at FVTPL. Financial assets measured at FVTPL are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value. Fair value gains and losses together with interest coupons and dividend income are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income within Gains on Investment Assets held at fair value in the period in which they occur. The fair values of assets and liabilities traded in active markets are based on current bid and offer prices respectively. If the market is not active the Group establishes a fair value by using valuation techniques. In addition, on initial recognition the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.\nThe Group does not hold any FVOCI assets.\nCLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT - FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Financial liabilities are classified and subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for:\n•\t Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: this classification is applied to derivatives, financial liabilities held for trading and other financial liabilities designated as such at initial recognition. Gains or losses on financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss are presented partially in other comprehensive income (the amount of change in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability, which is determined as the amount that is not attributable to change in market conditions that give rise to market risk) and partially in profit or loss (the remaining amount of change in the fair value of the liability). This is unless such a presentation would create, or enlarge, an accounting mismatch, in which case the gains and losses attributable to changes in the credit risk of the liability are also presented in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.\n•\t Financial liabilities arising from the transfer of financial assets which did not qualify for derecognition, whereby a financial liability is recognised for the consideration received for the transfer.\nIn subsequent years, the Group recognises any expense incurred on the financial liability.\n•\t Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments.\nCREDIT ASSETS AT AMORTISED COST Loans are initially recognised at a carrying value equivalent to the funds advanced to the borrower plus the cost of acquisition fees and transaction costs. After initial recognition loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method (“EIRM”) less expected credit losses (see Note 9).\nEXPECTED CREDIT LOSS ALLOWANCE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS MEASURED AT AMORTISED COST The credit impairment charge or release in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income represents the change in expected credit losses which are recognised for loans and advances to borrowers, other financial assets held at amortised cost.\nIFRS 9 applies a single impairment model to all financial instruments subject to impairment testing.

In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, allowance (or provision) is made for expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime expected credit losses). Financial assets where 12-month expected credit losses are recognised are considered to be Stage 1; financial assets which are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in Stage 2; and financial assets which have defaulted or are otherwise considered to be credit-impaired are allocated to Stage 3. Stage 2 and Stage 3 are based on lifetime expected credit losses.\nThe measurement of expected credit loss (“ECL”), is primarily based on the product of the instrument’s probability of default (“PD”), loss given default (“LGD”) and exposure at default (“EAD”), taking into account the value of any collateral held or other mitigants of loss and including the impact of discounting using the EIR.\n•\t The PD represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation, either over the next 12 months (“12M PD”), or over the remaining lifetime (“Lifetime PD”) of the obligation.\n•\t EAD is based on the amounts the Group expects to be owed at the time of default, over the next 12 months or over the remaining lifetime. For example, for a revolving commitment, the Group includes the current drawn balance plus any further amount that is expected to be drawn up to the current contractual limit by the time of default, should it occur. The EAD is discounted back to the reporting date using the EIR determined at initial recognition.\n•\t LGD represents the Group’s expectation of the extent of loss on a defaulted exposure. LGD varies by type of counterparty, type and seniority of claim and availability of collateral or other credit support.\nLGD is expressed as a percentage loss per unit of EAD. LGD is calculated on a 12-month or lifetime basis, where 12-month LGD is the percentage of loss expected to be made if the default occurs in the next 12 months and Lifetime LGD is the percentage of loss expected to be made if the default occurs over the remaining expected lifetime of the loan (“Lifetime LGD”).\nThe ECL is determined by estimating the PD, LGD and EAD for each individual exposure or collective segment. These three components are multiplied together and adjusted for the likelihood of survival (i.e. the exposure has not prepaid or defaulted in an earlier month). This effectively calculates an ECL, which is then discounted back to the reporting date and summed. The discount rate used in the ECL calculation is the original EIR or an approximation thereof. The Lifetime PD is developed by applying a maturity profile to the current 12-month PD.\nThe maturity profile looks at how defaults develop on a portfolio from the point of initial recognition throughout the lifetime of the loans. The maturity profile is based on historical observed data and is assumed to be the same across all assets within a portfolio and credit grade band where supported by historical analysis. The 12-month and lifetime EADs are determined based on the expected payment profile, which varies by product type:\n•\t For amortising products and bullet repayment loans, this is based on the contractual repayments owed by the borrower over a 12-month or lifetime basis. This is also adjusted for any expected overpayments made by a borrower.\nEarly repayment/refinance assumptions are also incorporated into the calculation.\n•\t For revolving products, the EAD is predicted by taking current drawn balance and adding a “credit conversion factor” which allows for the expected drawdown of the remaining limit by the time of default. These assumptions vary by product type and current limit utilisation band, based on analysis of the Group’s recent default data.\nThe 12-month and lifetime LGDs are determined based on the factors which impact the recoveries made post default. These vary by product type.\n•\t For secured products, this is primarily based on collateral type and projected collateral values, historical discounts to market/book values due to forced sales, time to repossession and recovery costs observed.\nFinancial Statements POLLEN STREET 135",

Stage 1 estimates use a maximum of a 12-month PD, while Stage 2 estimates use a lifetime PD. The main difference between Stage 2 and Stage 3 is that Stage 3 is effectively the point at which there has been a default event. For financial assets in Stage 3, lifetime ECL continues to be recognised but now recognises interest income on a net basis. This means that interest income is calculated based on the gross carrying amount of the financial asset less ECL.\nStage 3 estimates continue to leverage existing processes for estimating losses on impaired loans, however, these processes are updated to reflect the requirements of IFRS 9, including the requirement to consider multiple forward-looking scenarios using independent third-party economic information.\nMovements between Stage 1 and Stage 2 are based on whether an instrument’s credit risk as at the reporting date has increased significantly relative to the date it was initially recognised. Where the credit risk subsequently improves such that it no longer represents a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the asset is transferred back to Stage 1.\nIn assessing whether a borrower has had a significant increase in credit risk, the following indicators are considered:\n•\t Significant change in collateral value (secured facilities only) which is expected to increase the risk of default; •\t Actual or expected significant adverse change in operating results of the borrower or performance of collateral; •\t Significant adverse changes in business, financial and/or economic conditions in the market in which the borrower operates; •\t Actual or expected forbearance or restructuring; •\t Significant increase in credit spread, where this information is available; and •\t Early signs of cashflow/liquidity problems such as delay in servicing of payables.\nHowever, as a backstop, unless identified at an earlier stage, the credit risk of financial assets is deemed to have increased significantly when repayments are more than 30 days past due. Movements between Stage 2 and Stage 3 are based on whether financial assets are credit impaired as at the reporting date.\nIFRS 9 contains a rebuttable presumption that default occurs no later than when a payment is 90 days past due. The Group uses this 90-day backstop for all its assets except for UK second charge mortgages, where the Group has assumed a backstop of 180 days past due as mortgage exposures more than 90 days past due, but less than 180 days, typically show high cure rates and this aligns to the Group’s risk management practices.\nAssets can move in both directions through the stages of the impairment model.\nIn assessing whether a borrower is credit-impaired, the following qualitative indicators are considered:\n•\t Whether the borrower is in breach of financial covenants, for example where concessions have been made by the lender relating to the borrower’s financial difficulty or there are significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions on which the borrower operates; •\t Where the credit risk has increased, the remaining lifetime PD at the reporting date is assessed in comparison to the residual lifetime PD expected at the reporting date when the exposure was first recognised; and •\t Any cases of forbearance.\nThe criteria above have been applied to all Credit Assets at amortised cost held by the Group and are consistent with the definition of default used for internal credit risk management purposes. The default definition has been applied consistently to model the PD, EAD and LGD throughout the Group’s expected credit loss calculations.\nInputs into the assessment of whether a financial instrument is in default and their significance may vary over time to reflect changes in circumstances.\nUnder IFRS 9, when determining whether the credit risk (i.e. the risk of default) on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, reasonable and supportable information that is Annual Report and Accounts 2024 POLLEN STREET 136\n\nTABLE\nColumns: • \nFor unsecured products, LGDs are typically set, However, as a backstop, unless identified at an earlier\nat product level due to the limited differentiation | stage, the credit risk of financial assets is deemed to\nin recoveries achieved across different borrowers. | have increased significantly when repayments are\nThese LGDs are influenced by collection strategies, | more than 30 days past due.

The process has involved developing two additional economic scenarios and considering the relative probabilities of each outcome.\nThe base case represents a most likely outcome and is aligned with information used for other purposes, such as strategic planning and budgeting. The number of scenarios and their attributes are reassessed at each reporting date. All of the portfolios of the Group use one positive, one optimistic and one downside scenario. These scenario weightings are determined by a combination of statistical analysis and expert judgement, taking account of the range of possible outcomes each chosen scenario is representative of.\nThe estimation and application of forward-looking information requires significant judgement. PD, LGD and EAD inputs used to estimate Stage 1 and Stage 2 credit loss allowances, are modelled and adjusted based on the macroeconomic variables (or changes in macroeconomic variables) that are most closely correlated with credit losses in the relevant portfolio. The Group has utilised macroeconomic scenarios prepared and provided by Oxford Economics (“Oxford”). Oxford combines two decades of forecast data with the quantitative assessment of the current risks facing the global and domestic economy to produce robust forward-looking distributions for the economy. Oxford construct three alternative scenarios at specific percentile points in the distribution. In any distribution, the probability of a given discrete scenario is close to zero. Therefore, scenario probabilities represent the probability of that scenario or similar scenarios occurring. In effect, a given scenario represents the average of a broader bucket of similar severity scenarios and the probability reflects the width of that bucket. Given that it is known where the IFRS 9 scenarios sit in the distribution (the percentiles), their probability (the width of the bucket of similar scenarios) depends on how many scenarios are chosen. Scenario probabilities must add up to 100 per cent so the more scenarios chosen, the smaller the section of the distribution, or bucket, each scenario represents and therefore the smaller the probability. This allows the probabilities to be calculated according to whichever subset of scenarios have been chosen for use in the ECL calculation.\nOxford updates these scenarios on a quarterly basis to reflect changes to the macroeconomic environment. The Group updates the scenarios during the year if economic conditions change materially.\nOxford selects the scenarios to represent a broadly fixed probability within the distribution of potential outcomes. As such the Group has maintained the probability of each scenario at a broadly constant level despite the changing macroeconomic environment.\nThe Base case is given a 40 per cent weighting and the downside and upside a 30 per cent weighting each, which is unchanged from the prior year.\nAs with any economic forecasts, the projections and likelihoods of occurrence are subject to a high degree of inherent uncertainty and therefore the actual outcomes may be significantly different to those projected. The Group considers these forecasts to represent its best estimate of the possible outcomes and has analysed the non-linearities and asymmetries within the Group’s different portfolios to establish that the chosen scenarios are appropriately representative of the range of possible scenarios.\nOther forward-looking considerations not otherwise incorporated within the above scenarios, such as the impact of any regulatory, legislative or political changes, have also been considered, but no adjustment has been made to the ECL for such factors. This is reviewed and monitored for appropriateness at each reporting date.\nEXPECTED CREDIT LOSS ALLOWANCE FOR RECEIVABLES Receivables consist of trade and other debtor balances and prepayments and accrued income.\nTrade receivables balances are represented by fees receivable for investment fund management and advisory services provided during the year to the Group’s customers.

Receivable balances are generally collected on a monthly or quarterly basis and are therefore short-term in nature. The Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs and recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. Given the historic rate of recoverability is 100 per cent and the absence of reasons to believe the recoverability pattern will change, management’s assessment is that ECL calculated under IFRS 9 would be immaterial at the end of the current and previous reporting period. Management will continue to assess the recoverability at each reporting date for changes in the circumstances surrounding the recoverability of the trade and other receivables, and recognise an expected credit loss allowance when appropriate.\nWRITE-OFF POLICY FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS MEASURED AT AMORTISED COST A loan or advance is normally written off, either partially or in full, against the related allowance when the proceeds from realising any available security have been received or there is no realistic prospect of recovery and the amount of the loss has been determined. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off decrease the amount of impairment losses recorded in the income statement.\nMODIFICATION OF LOANS The Group sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of loans to customers. When this happens, the Group assesses whether or not the new terms are substantially different to the original terms. The Group does this by considering, among others, the following factors:\n•\t if the borrower is in financial difficulty, whether the modification merely reduces the contractual cash flows to amounts the borrower is expected to be able to pay; •\t whether any substantial new terms are introduced, such as a profit share/equity-based return that substantially affects the risk profile of the loan; •\t significant extension of the loan term when the borrower is not in financial difficulty; •\t significant change in the interest rate; •\t change in the currency the loan is denominated in; and •\t insertion of collateral, other security or credit enhancements that significantly affect the credit risk associated with the loan.\nIf the terms are substantially different, the Group derecognises the original financial asset and recognises a new asset at fair value and recalculates a new EIR for the asset. The date of renegotiation is consequently considered to be the date of initial recognition for impairment calculation purposes, including for the purpose of determining whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred. However, the Group also assesses whether the new financial asset recognised is deemed to be credit-impaired at initial recognition, especially in circumstances where the renegotiation was driven by the debtor being unable to make the originally agreed payments. Differences in the carrying amounts are also recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income as a gain or loss on derecognition. If the terms are not substantially different, the renegotiation or modification does not result in derecognition, and the Group recalculates the gross carrying amount based on the revised cash flows of the financial asset and recognises a modification gain or loss in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. The new gross carrying amount is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original EIR (or credit-adjusted EIR for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets).\nMODIFICATION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS The Group sometimes modifies the terms of loans provided to customers due to commercial renegotiations, or for distressed loans, with a view to maximising recovery.\nSuch restructuring activities include extended payment term arrangements, payment holidays and payment forgiveness. Restructuring policies and practice are based on indicators or criteria which, in the judgement of management, indicate that payment will most likely continue. These policies are kept under continuous review. Restructuring is most commonly applied to term loans.\nThe risk of default of such assets after modification is assessed at the reporting date and compared with the risk under the original terms at initial recognition, when the modification is not substantial and so does not result in derecognition of the original assets. The Group monitors the subsequent performance of modified assets. The Group may determine that the credit risk has significantly improved after restructuring, so that the assets are moved from Stage 2 or Stage 3.\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2024 POLLEN STREET 138",

      "text": "COLLATERAL AND OTHER CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS The Group employs a range of policies to mitigate credit risk. The most common of these is accepting collateral for funds advanced. The Group has internal policies of the acceptability of specific classes of collateral or credit risk mitigation.\nThe Group prepares a valuation of the collateral obtained as part of the loan origination process. This assessment is reviewed periodically. The principal collateral types for loans and advances are:\n•\t mortgages over residential properties; •\t security over our borrowers receivables; •\t margin agreement for derivatives, for which the Group has also entered into master netting agreements; •\t charges over business assets such as premises, inventory and accounts receivable; and •\t charges over financial instruments such as debt securities and equities.\nLonger-term finance and lending to corporate entities are generally secured; revolving individual credit facilities are generally unsecured.\nCollateral held as security for financial assets other than loans and advances depends on the nature of the instrument. Derivatives are also generally collateralised, such as collateralised debt obligations, in order to provide collateral as a form of security for the obligations arising from the derivative.\nThe Group closely monitors collateral held for financial assets considered to be credit-impaired, as it becomes more likely that the Group will take possession of collateral to mitigate potential credit losses.\nDERECOGNITION OTHER THAN A MODIFICATION Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognised when the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the assets have expired, or when they have been transferred and either (i) the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, or (ii) the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and the Group has not retained control.\nThe Group enters into transactions where it retains the contractual rights to receive cash flows from assets but assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to other entities and transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards. These transactions are accounted for as “pass-through” transfers that result in derecognition if the Group:\n•\t has no obligation to make payments unless it collects equivalent amounts from the assets; •\t is prohibited from selling or pledging the assets; and •\t has an obligation to remit any cash it collects from the assets without material delay.\nDERECOGNITION Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished (i.e. when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires). Different terms, as well as substantial modifications of the terms of existing financial liabilities, are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The terms are substantially different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including any fees paid net of any fees received and discounted using the original EIR, is at least 10 per cent different from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. In addition, other qualitative factors, such as the currency that the instrument is denominated in, changes in the type of interest rate, new conversion features attached to the instrument and change in covenants are also taken into consideration.\nIf an exchange of debt instruments or modification of terms is accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred are recognised as part of the gain or loss on the extinguishment. If the exchange or modification is not accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified liability.\nINVESTMENTS HELD AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS The investments held at FVTPL include Equity Assets and Credit Assets.\nEquity Assets held at FVTPL are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines (“IPEVCV”) effective 1 January 2019 with the latest update in December 2022 as recommended by the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association.\nFinancial Statements POLLEN STREET 139",

Examples of equity instruments include ordinary shares or investments in Private Equity funds managed or advised by the Group. Investments into funds managed by the Group are valued on the net asset value of each fund. The valuations typically reflect the fair value of the Group’s proportionate share of each investment as at the reporting date.\nCredit Assets at FVTPL consists of loans made to counterparties where the contractual cash flows do not meet the requirements of the solely payments of principal and interest test or are otherwise classified at fair value, together with investments in Private Credit funds managed or advised by the Group.\nSee the section on Classification and measurement - Financial assets earlier in this Note. Examples of credit instruments include credit instruments where incremental cash flows are due contingent on certain events occurring.\nThese Credit Assets at FVTPL are priced at their amortised cost value as a proxy for the fair value, given that they are floating rate assets and performing in line with expectations with limited credit risk.\nCredit Assets at FVTPL also consists of investments in Private Credit Funds managed by the Group and are valued based off the net asset value of each fund.\nThe valuations typically reflect the fair value of the Group’s proportionate share of each investment as at the reporting date.\nPurchases and sales of unquoted investments are recognised when the contract for acquisition or sale becomes unconditional.\nIFRS 13 requires the Group to classify its financial instruments held at fair value using a hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in the valuation methodologies. These are as follows:\n•\t Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical investments.\n•\t Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayments, credit risk, etc.).\n•\t Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Group’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).\nAn investment is always categorised as Level 1, 2 or 3 in its entirety. In certain cases, the fair value measurement for an investment may use a number of different inputs that fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgement and is specific to the investment.\nThe gain on fair value is shown in the ‘Gains on Investment Assets held at fair value’ line on the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.\nFIXED ASSETS Fixed assets are shown at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated by the Group on a straight-line basis by reference to the original cost, estimated useful life and residual value. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. The period of estimated useful life for this purpose is up to 10 years. Residual values are assumed to be nil.\nPlant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.\nDepreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method.\nDepreciation is provided on the following basis:\nFixtures and fittings\n\n3 years Office equipment\n\n3 years Electric vehicles\n\n5 years Leasehold improvements\n\n10 years The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting date.\nGains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2024 POLLEN STREET 140",

If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed, and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.\nAfter initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit (“CGU”) is less than its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognised on the goodwill is not reversed subsequently. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s CGUs or group of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.\nA CGU represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\nWhere goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the CGU retained.\nINTANGIBLES Intangible assets, which constitute acquired customer relationship assets acquired from a business combination, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.\nIntangible assets are assessed at each reporting date when there are indicators of impairment.\nAmortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the amortised amount of the assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives.\nLEASES The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nGroup as a lessee The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.\nThe Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and lease assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.\nLease assets The Group recognises lease assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Lease assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of lease assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, an estimate of costs to be incurred in restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Lease assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nIf ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.\nLease liabilities At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees.\nThe lease payments also include payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate.\nFinancial Statements POLLEN STREET 141",

The realised amount is the amount actually received. For the unrealised performance, the amount recognised is determined against an assessment of the underlying investor returns exceeding an agreed threshold or hurdle, and is either accounted for under IFRS 9 (for carried interest partnerships acquired as part of the Combination) or under IFRS 15 (for nonacquired carried interest partnerships).\nMovements in fair value, and amounts accrued as revenue under IFRS 15, are shown in the ‘Carried interest and performance fee income’ line on the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income, with the outstanding balance shown in the ‘Carried interest’ line on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and are typically presented as non-current assets unless they are expected to be received within the next 12 months.\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents, which are presented as a single class of asset on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, comprise cash at bank, including cash that is restricted and held in reserve.\nFINANCIAL LIABILITIES Financial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.\nDERIVATIVES The Group uses foreign exchange spot, forward and swap transactions to hedge foreign exchange movements in non-GBP assets or liabilities in order to minimise foreign exchange exposure.\nDerivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting date. The Group does not designate derivatives as cash flow hedges and so all fair value movements are recognised in the Income Statement in the ‘Gains on Investment Assets held at fair value’ line on the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.\nThe fair value of unsettled forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to the market for forward contracts with similar maturities.\nINTEREST-BEARING BORROWINGS Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recognised at a carrying value equivalent to the proceeds received net of issue costs associated with the borrowings.\nAfter initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (“EIR”) method.\nFINANCE COSTS Finance costs are accrued on the EIR basis and are presented as a separate line on the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.\nDIVIDENDS Dividends to shareholders are recognised in the period in which they are paid.\nINCOME The Group has four primary sources of income:\nmanagement fee income, carried interest and performance fee income, interest income on Credit Assets held at amortised cost, and gains on Investment Assets held at fair value.\nManagement fee income includes fees charged by the Group to the funds that it manages for the provision of investment fund management and advisory services, which are treated as a single performance obligation.

Accordingly, the group of investors of each fund are identified as a customer for accounting purposes.\nManagement fees are earned over a period and are recognised on an accrual basis in the same period in which the service is performed. Management fees are based on an agreed percentage of either committed or invested capital, depending on the fund and its life stage, in accordance with individual management agreements or limited partnership agreements.\nIncome is measured based on the consideration specified in the contracts and exclude amounts collected on behalf of third parties, discounts and value added taxes.\nFor Private Equity managed funds, management fee income is charged from the inception of the fund. Where an LP enters the fund as part of subsequent closes “catch-up” management fee income is calculated and charged as if the LP had entered the fund on first close. These management fees are earned over a prior period where the provision of investment fund management and advisory services has already been provided and the corresponding performance obligation is satisfied.\nTherefore, these catch-up management fees are recognised immediately in full. This is not applicable on Private Credit funds given that management fee income is charged on invested capital, rather than commitments.\nCarried interest and performance fee income includes income recognised under IFRS 15 from holdings in carried interest partnerships where the Group receives variable returns as an incentive for the funds that it manages. Carried interest represents a share of fund profits through the Group’s holdings in carried interest partnerships. The amount is determined by the level of accumulated profits exceeding an agreed threshold or hurdle. The carried interest income is recognised when the performance obligations are expected to be met. Income is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that there would not be a significant reversal of any accumulated revenue recognised on the completion of a fund. The uncertainty of future fund performance is reduced through the application of discounts in the calculation of carried interest income. Performance fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the appreciation in the net asset value of a fund above a defined hurdle, and are recognised on an accrual basis when the fee amount can be estimated reliably, and it is highly probable that it will not be subject to significant reversal.\nManagement fees and performance fees are charged to the Investment Company by the Asset Manager.\nThese fees are shown in Note 5, operating segments.\nHowever, they are eliminated on consolidation.\nInterest income on Credit Assets held at amortised cost is generated from loans originated by the Group. Interest from loans are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income for all instruments measured at amortised cost using the EIRM. The EIRM is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate (“EIR”) is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. When calculating the EIR, the Group takes into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument, for example prepayment options, but does not consider future credit losses. The calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the EIR, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts. Fees and commissions which are not considered integral to the EIR model and deposit interest income are recognised on an accruals basis when the service has been provided or received.\nGains on Investment Assets held at Fair Value include realised and unrealised income on assets accounted for at fair value, including equity assets and credit assets. Refer to the Investments held at fair value through profit or loss section for further details.\nPENSIONS The Group makes contributions into employee personal pension schemes. Once the contributions have been paid, the Group has no further payment obligations.\nThe contributions are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income when they fall due.\nAmounts not paid are shown in accruals as a liability in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\nFinancial Statements POLLEN STREET 143",

      "text": "SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group grants annual bonuses to its Executive Directors and other senior employees some of which are deferred in accordance with the Group’s Remuneration Policy. Deferred awards may be used to acquire shares in Pollen Street Group Limited (a Share-Based Award), or fund commitments into Pollen Street managed funds (Co-Investment Opportunity) and are subject to malus and clawback provisions.\nThe Share-Based Awards generally vest after three years, subject to the opportunity for co-investment.\nThe Co-Investment Opportunity permits the employee to collect the deferred award early, either in shares or up front in cash, provided they elect to apply the after-tax proceeds of the deferred award into a fund managed by the Group that has a contractual duration of longer than three years.\nThe Group accounts for Share-Based Awards as share-based payments. The awards are considered to be compound financial instruments, because the employee has the right to demand settlement in cash. The Group first measures the fair value of the cash component, which is considered to be a cash-settled share-based payment, and then measures the fair value of the equity component taking into account that the counterparty must forfeit the right to receive cash in order to receive the equity instrument, which is considered to be an equity-settled share-based payment.\nSEGMENTAL REPORTING The Group has two segments: the Asset Manager segment and the Investment Company segment.\nThe primary revenue streams for the Asset Manager segment consist of management fees and performance fees or carried interest arising from managing Private Equity and Private Credit funds.\nThe Investment Company segment primarily consists of the Group Investment Assets and borrowings. The primary revenue stream for the Investment Company segment is interest income and fair value gains on Investments held at fair value.\nThe Asset Manager segment charges management and performance fees to the Investment Company segment for managing the segment’s assets. These fees are shown in the segmental results. However, they are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 5 for further details.\nTAXATION Although the Company is incorporated and registered under the laws of Guernsey, the Company elected to be UK resident for taxation purposes, and as a result is non-tax resident in Guernsey.\nFurthermore, following the Reorganisation that occurred on 24 January 2024, Pollen Street Limited ceased to be classified as an investment trust under Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. As such, Pollen Street Limited will incur corporation tax on its profits from the beginning of the period. Prior to 24 January 2024, the tax expense of the Group arose within the Asset Manager segment and comprised current and deferred tax. Further information on the Reorganisation is available in Note 4.\nCurrent income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.\nCurrent income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.\nDeferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2024 POLLEN STREET 144",

      "text": "3. Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgements The UK-adopted International Accounting Standards requires the Group to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. IFRS requires the Directors, in preparing the Group’s financial statements, to select suitable accounting policies, apply them consistently and make judgements and estimates that are reasonable. The Group’s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and expectations of future events and are reviewed on an ongoing basis.\nAlthough these estimates are based on the Directors’ best estimate of the amount, actual results may differ materially from those estimates.\nESTIMATES The estimates of most significance to the financial statements are detailed below. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.\nExpected Credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost The calculation of the Group’s ECL allowances and provisions against loan commitments and guarantees under IFRS 9 is complex and involves the use of significant judgement and estimation.\nLoan Impairment Provisions represent an estimate of the losses incurred in the loan portfolios at the balance sheet date. Individual impairment losses are determined as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the loans’ original EIR. The calculation involves the formulation and incorporation of multiple forward-looking economic conditions into ECL to meet the measurement objective of IFRS 9, depending on a range of factors such as changes in the economic environment in the UK. The most significant factors are set out below.\nDefinition of default - The PD of an exposure, both over a 12-month period and over its lifetime, is a key input to the measurement of the ECL allowance.\nDefault has occurred when there is evidence that the customer is experiencing significant financial difficulty which is likely to affect the ability to repay amounts due.\nA number of the Group’s loans are secured against underlying collateral. The Directors do not consider the value of this collateral when assessing the probability of default. However, the structure of certain lending arrangements may improve the Group’s ability to recover borrowings, even in cases of heightened default risk.\nThe definition of default adopted by the Group is described in expected credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost above. As noted on page 136, the Group has rebutted the presumption in IFRS 9 that default occurs no later than when a payment is 90 days past due on some of its portfolio.\nThe lifetime of an exposure - To derive the PDs necessary to calculate the ECL allowance it is necessary to estimate the expected life of each financial instrument. A range of approaches has been adopted across different product groupings including the full contractual life and taking into account behavioural factors such as early repayments and refinancing. The Group has defined the lifetime for each product by analysing the time taken for all losses to be observed and for a material proportion of the assets to fully resolve through either closure or write-off.\nSignificant increase in credit risk (“SICR”) - Performing assets are classified as either Stage 1 or Stage 2. An ECL allowance equivalent to 12 months’ expected credit losses is established against assets in Stage 1; assets classified as Stage 2 carry an ECL allowance equivalent to lifetime expected credit losses.\nAssets are transferred from Stage 1 to Stage 2 when there has been a SICR since initial recognition.\nA number of the Group’s loans are secured against underlying collateral. The Directors do not consider the value of this collateral when assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. However, the structure of certain lending arrangements may improve the Group’s ability to recover borrowings, even in cases of heightened default risk, therefore influencing whether there has been a SICR The Group uses a quantitative test together with qualitative indicators and a backstop of 30 days past due for determining whether there has been a SICR.\nThe setting of precise trigger points combined with risk indicators requires judgement. The use of different trigger points may have a material impact upon the size of the ECL allowance.\nFinancial Statements POLLEN STREET 147",

      "text": "Forward-looking information - IFRS 9 requires the incorporation of forward-looking macroeconomic information that is reasonable and supportable, but it provides limited guidance on how this should be performed. The measurement of expected credit losses is required to reflect an unbiased probability-weighted range of possible future outcomes.\nIn order to do this the Group uses a model to project a number of key variables to generate future economic scenarios. These are ranked according to severity of loss and three economic scenarios have been selected to represent an unbiased and full loss distribution.\nThey represent a “most likely outcome” (the Base case scenario) and two, less likely, “outer” scenarios, referred to as the “Upside” and “Downside” scenarios.\nThese scenarios are used to produce a weighted average PD for each product grouping which is used to calculate the related ECL allowance. This weighting scheme is deemed appropriate for the computation of unbiased ECL. Key scenario assumptions are set using external economist forecasts, helping to ensure the IFRS 9 scenarios are unbiased and maximise the use of independent information. Using externally available forecast distributions helps ensure independence in scenario construction. While key economic variables are set with reference to external distributional forecasts, the overall narrative of the scenarios is aligned to the macroeconomic risks faced by the Group at 31 December 2024.\nThe choice of alternative scenarios and probability weighting is a combination of quantitative analysis and judgemental assessments, designed to ensure that the full range of possible outcomes and material non‑linearity are captured. Paths for the two outer scenarios are benchmarked to the Base scenario and reflect the economic risk assessment. Scenario probabilities reflect management judgement and are informed by data analysis of past recessions, transitions in and out of recession, and the current economic outlook. The key assumptions made, and the accompanying paths, represent management’s “best estimate” of a scenario at a specified probability.\nSuitable narratives are developed for the central scenario and the paths of the two outer scenarios. It may be insufficient to use three scenarios in certain economic environments. Additional analysis may be requested at management’s discretion, including the production of extra scenarios. We anticipate there will only be limited instances when the standard approach will not apply. The Base case, Upside and Downside scenarios are usually generated annually and those described herein reflect the conditions in place at the balance sheet date and are only updated during the period if economic conditions change significantly.\nThe Group’s mild upside scenario can be thought of as an alternative, more optimistic, base case in which several different upside risks materialise. In this scenario, the UK economy records growth of 1.4 per cent in 2025 and 1.7 per cent in 2026. The labour market recovers gradually, and the unemployment rate falls to its recent decade-low of 4.0 per cent by 2029.\nSupported by the turnaround in confidence, incomes and employment, residential house prices only see a mild fall in 2025-26 and recover thereafter. A sharp increase in consumption lifts financial market sentiment from its current levels resulting in renewed gains in asset prices.\nThe base case forecasts unemployment to peak at 4.4 per cent in December 2025, and the Bank of England base rate to reduce to 2.5 per cent by the end of 2028. The downside scenario forecasts unemployment to reach a peak of 6.7 per cent in late 2027 and remain relatively high thereafter, staying above 5.8 per cent over the entire forecast period.\nTo counter the economic downturn, the downside scenario forecasts the base rate to fall more quickly to 1.8 per cent by December 2026.\nThe one-year forecast changes in key economic drivers are shown in the table below10.\nSee Note 9 for a breakdown of IFRS 9 provisioning.\nAs at 31 December 2024 Base Upside Downside UK unemployment rate yearly change (0.03)% (0.67)% 1.07% UK HPI yearly change 1.19% 3.20% (7.13)% UK Base Rate yearly change (1.00)% 0.52% (1.85)% 10 Source: Oxford Economics - IFRS 9 Macroeconomic Scenarios Service: UK Country Report Q4 2024 Annual Report and Accounts 2024 POLLEN STREET 148",

LGD varies by type of counterparty, type and seniority of claim and availability of collateral or other credit support. LGD is expressed as a percentage loss per unit of exposure at the time of default. LGD is calculated on a 12-month or lifetime basis, where 12-month LGD is the percentage of loss expected to be made if the default occurs in the next 12 months and Lifetime LGD is the percentage of loss expected to be made if the default occurs over the remaining expected lifetime of the loan.\nThe 12-month and lifetime LGDs are determined based on the factors which impact the recoveries made post default. These vary by product type:\n•\t For secured products, this is primarily based on collateral type and projected collateral values, historical discounts to market/book values due to forced sales, time to repossession and recovery costs observed.\n•\t For unsecured products, LGDs are typically set at product level due to the limited differentiation in recoveries achieved across different borrowers.\nThese LGDs are influenced by collection strategies, including contracted debt sales and price.\nExposure at default - referred to as EAD, is based on the amounts expected to be owed at the time of default, over the next 12 months or over the remaining lifetime. IFRS 9 requires an assumed draw down profile for committed amounts.\nThe Group also considers post-model adjustments to address model limitations or factors that have not been captured in the models. These represent the factors that are not fully accounted for as part of the modelling described above, such as potential uncertainty arising from the cost-of-living crisis and the current economic environment.\nEquity Asset valuation The valuation of unquoted investments and investments for which there is an inactive market is a key area of estimation and may cause material adjustment to the carrying value of those assets and liabilities. The unquoted Equity Assets are valued on a periodic basis using techniques including a market multiple approach, costs approach and/or income approach. The valuation process is collaborative, involving the finance and investment functions of the Group with the final valuations being reviewed by the Valuation Committee, which is a management-level Committee responsible for the oversight of the valuation of investments. The techniques used include earnings multiples, discounted cash flow analysis, the value of recent transactions and the net asset value of the investment. The valuations often reflect a synthesis of a number of different approaches in determining the final fair value estimate. The individual approach for each investment will vary depending on relevant factors that a market participant would take into account in pricing the asset. These might include the specific industry dynamics, the Investee’s stage of development, profitability, growth prospects or risk as well as the rights associated with the particular security.\nIncreases or decreases in any of the inputs in isolation may result in higher or lower fair value measurements.\nChanges in fair value of all investments held at fair value, which includes Equity Assets are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. On disposal, realised gains and losses are also recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. Transaction costs are included within gains or losses on investments held at fair value, although any related interest income, dividend income and finance costs are disclosed separately in the financial statements.\nSensitivity analysis has been performed on equity asset valuations in Note 10.\nImpairment assessment for Goodwill Goodwill is assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date and whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit (“CGU”) is less than its carrying amount, and tested for impairment annually. For the impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and Financial Statements POLLEN STREET 149",

      "text": "which represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\nThe recoverable amount of CGUs is determined based on the higher of value-in-use and fair value less costs to sell. Key assumptions in the discounted cash flow projections are prepared based on current economic conditions and comprise an estimated long-term growth rate, the period over which future cashflows have been forecast, the weighted average cost of capital and estimated operating margins.\nWherever possible, the inputs into the discounted cash flow projections used for the impairment test of goodwill are based on third party observable data.\nSensitivity analysis has been performed on the goodwill impairment assessment in Note 13.\nCarried interest Carried interest represents unrealised and realised shares of fund profits from holdings in carried interest partnerships where the Group receives variable returns as an incentive for management of the underlying funds. The realised amount is the amount actually received. For the unrealised performance, the amount recognised is determined against an assessment of the underlying investor returns exceeding an agreed threshold or hurdle, and is either accounted for under IFRS 9 (for carried interest partnerships acquired as part of the Combination) or under IFRS 15 (for non-acquired).\nMovements in fair value, and amounts accrued as revenue under IFRS 15, are shown in the ‘Carried interest and performance fee income’ line on the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income, with the outstanding balance shown in the ‘Carried interest’ line on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\nCarried interest at fair value is only recognised under IFRS 15 provided it has been determined as being highly probable that there will not be a significant reversal. The value of carried interest, under this method, has been modelled by assessing the value of the assets in the fund as well as the terms of the carried interest arrangements that the Group is a beneficiary of. The value of the assets have been discounted to ensure that it is highly probable that there will not be a significant reversal.\nThe discount applied for each fund depends on the stage and maturity profile of each fund, and therefore recognises the de-risking of the income over time, taking into account diversity of assets, whether there has been a recent market correction and the expected average remaining holding period.\nIf the discount rates were unwound to give the notional carried interest due to the Group based on unrealised fair value of investment in the relevant funds this would result in additional carried interest income of £13.1 million (2023: £5.2 million) being recognised.\nCarried interest at fair value is modelled by estimating from the value of the funds’ investments and the amount that would be due to the Group under the terms of the carried interest arrangements if the assets were realised at these values. Carried interest includes an embedded option where carried interest holders participate in gains but not losses of the fund subject to certain hurdles. The value of this option has been modelled using a variety of techniques, including the Black Scholes option valuation model and scenario analysis.\nSensitivity analysis has been performed on carried interest valuations in Note 14.\nJUDGEMENTS The critical judgements relate to the consolidation of Group companies, the consolidation of fund investments and the accounting for carried interest partnerships.\nConsolidation of Group companies Determining whether the Group has control of an entity is generally straightforward when based on ownership of the majority of the voting capital.\nHowever, in certain instances, this determination will involve significant judgement, particularly in the case of structured entities where voting rights are often not the determining factor in decisions over the relevant activities. This judgement may involve assessing the purpose and design of the entity. It will also often be necessary to consider whether the Group, or another involved party with power over the relevant activities, is acting as a principal in its own right or as an agent on behalf of others.\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2024 POLLEN STREET 150",

      "text": "Consolidation of fund investments It was assessed throughout the period whether the Group should consolidate investments in funds managed or advised by the Group into the results of the Group. Control is determined by the extent of which the Group has power over the investee, exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns.\nThe Group has assessed the legal nature of the relationships between the Group, the relevant fund, the General Partners and the LPs. This assessment included carrying out a control assessment of each LP in accordance with IFRS 10 to consider whether the LPs should be consolidated into the financial statements of the Group. The Group has determined that control over the LPs ultimately resides with the underlying fund majority investors and that the Group, through the Asset Manager, acts as an agent to the underlying fund majority investors and not as principal.\nThe Group also determined that as the manager, the Group has the power to influence the returns generated by the fund, but the Group’s interests typically represent only a small proportion of the total capital within each fund. The Group has therefore concluded that the Group acts as an agent, which is primarily engaged to act on behalf, and for the benefit, of the LPs rather than to act for its own benefit.\nAccounting for carried interest partnerships Carried interest represents unrealised and realised shares of fund profits from holdings in carried interest partnerships where the Group receives variable returns as an incentive for management of the underlying funds. The amount is determined by the level of accumulated profits exceeding an agreed threshold or hurdle. The rights are in the form of partnership interests in carried interest partnerships.\nThe Group has between 1 and 25 per cent of the total interests in these partnerships.\nThe Group has undertaken a control assessment of each carried interest partnership in accordance with IFRS 10 to consider whether they should be consolidated into the Group’s results. The Group has considered the nature of the relationships between the Group, the fund, the fund investors, the carried interest partnership and participants in the carried interest partnership. The Group has determined that the power to control the carried interest partnerships ultimately resides with the fund investors and that the Group is therefore an agent and not a principal. This is because the purpose and design of the carried interest partnerships and the carry rights in the fund are determined at the outset by each fund’s Limited Partner Agreement (“LPA”), which requires investor agreement and reflects investor expectations to incentivise individuals to enhance performance of the underlying fund. While the Group has some power over the carried interest partnerships, these powers are limited and represent the best interests of all carried interest holders collectively and hence, these are assessed to be on behalf of the fund investors.\nThe Group has assessed the payments and the returns the carried interest holders make and receive from their investment in carried interest and have considered whether those carried interest holders, who are also employees of the Group, were providing a service for the benefit of the Group or the investors in the fund. The Group concluded that the carried interest represents a separate relationship between the fund investors and the individual employees and that the carried interest represents an investment requiring the individuals to put their own capital at risk and that, after an initial vesting period, continued rights to returns from the investment is not dictated by continuation of employment. As a result of this, distributions from these carried interest partnerships are not consolidated in the Group’s Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\nIn addition, the Group has also considered the variability of returns for all carried interest partnerships and in doing so have determined that the Group is exposed to variable returns in the range of 1 to 25 per cent as at 31 December 2024, with the main beneficiaries of the carried interest partnership variable returns being the other participants. The Group concluded that the carried interest partnership are not controlled by the Group and therefore should not be consolidated.\nThe Group has also assessed whether the Group has significant influence over the carried interest partnerships under IAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. Where the Group has a share of 20 per cent or more of the rights to the carried interest, the Group is considered to have significant influence and therefore these carried interest partnerships are treated as an associate.\nFinancial Statements POLLEN STREET 151",

      "text": "Annual Report and Accounts 2024 b) Expected Credit Loss allowance for IFRS 9 Under the IFRS 9 expected credit loss model, impairment provisions are driven by changes in credit risk of instruments, with a provision for lifetime expected credit losses recognised where the risk of default of an instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition.\nThe following table analyses ECL by staging for the Group:\nGroup For the year ended 31 December 2024 £’000 For the year ended 31 December 2023 £’000 As at 1 January 8,311 9,281 Release for period - Stage 1 (97) (300) Release for period - Stage 2 (208) (21) Charge / (release) for period - Stage 3 898 (649) Charge / (release) for period 593 (970) Loans sold & write-offs - - Allowance for ECL 8,904 8,311 Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of ECL The recognition and measurement of ECL is highly complex and involves the use of significant judgement and estimation. This includes the formulation and incorporation of multiple forward-looking economic conditions into ECL to meet the measurement objective of IFRS 9.\nThe Group has adopted the use of three economic scenarios, representative of Oxford Economics view of forecast economic conditions, sufficient to calculate an unbiased ECL. They represent a “most likely outcome”, the Base scenario, and two, less likely, outer scenarios, referred to as the “Upside” and “Downside” scenarios.\nThe ECL recognised in these financial statements reflects the effect on expected credit losses of a range of possible outcomes, calculated on a probability‑weighted basis, based on the economic scenarios described in Note 3, including management overlays where required. The probability-weighted amount is typically a higher number than would result from using only the Base (most likely) economic scenario. ECLs typically have a non-linear relationship to the many factors which influence credit losses, such that more favourable macroeconomic factors do not reduce defaults as much as less favourable macroeconomic factors increase defaults. The ECL calculated for each of the scenarios represent range of possible outcomes that have been evaluated to estimate ECL. As a result, the ECL calculated for the Upside and Downside scenarios should not be taken to represent the upper and lower limits of possible actual ECL outcomes. There is a high degree of estimation uncertainty in numbers representing tail risk scenarios when assigned a 100 per cent weight. A wider range of possible ECL outcomes reflects uncertainty about the distribution of economic conditions and does not necessarily mean that credit risk on the associated loans is higher than for loans where the distribution of possible future economic conditions is narrower.\nFor Stage 3 impaired loans, LGD estimates consider independent recovery valuations provided by external valuers where available, or internal forecasts corresponding to anticipated economic conditions.\nAnalysis shows that the ECL would have been £0.5 million higher, as at 31 December 2024 (2023:\n£0.6 million higher), if the weighting of the scenarios were changed to allocate a 100 per cent weight to the downside scenario. The sensitivity of the ECL has been further analysed by assessing the impact of £10.0 million of portfolio Credit Assets at amortised cost moving from Stage 1 to Stage 2 based on the ECL coverage of the loan book at the reporting date. The analysis shows that the ECL would have been £0.2 million higher (2023:\n£0.6 million higher) under this sensitivity as the provision coverage increases from Stage 1 to Stage 2.\nPOLLEN STREET 162",

The goodwill relates to the acquisition of 100 per cent of the share capital of Pollen Street Capital Holdings Limited (“PSCHL”) by Pollen Street Limited (“PSL”) on 30 September 2022. The goodwill recognised was made up of one cash-generating unit, which includes future management and performance fees.\nAs per the requirements of IAS 36 “Impairment of assets”, goodwill is tested for impairment annually.\nThe goodwill recognised as part of the acquisition above is compared to a financial model used to estimate the value in use (“VIU”) of PSCHL. The value in use involves identifying the cashflows associated with the revenue streams of PSCHL and carrying out a forecast of future cashflows that are discounted back to their net present value based on discount rates obtained from relevant industry comparable information.\nGoodwill was tested for impairment on 31 December 2024 and no impairment was identified (2023: no impairment identified). The cashflows have been forecast four years into the future (2023: five years), where the final year is assigned a terminal value.\nThe value in use of goodwill was £328 million (2023:\n£296 million) which is £103 million (2023: £71 million) above the goodwill value of £225 million (2023:\n£225 million) presented by the Group. The value in use model has a number of assumptions; the most significant assumptions are the future income projections that are based on PSCHL’s forecast profit after tax, the discount rate used of 12.7 per cent (2023: 12.4 per cent), and the long-term growth rate of 3.9 per cent (2023: 3.6 per cent).\nThe future cashflow projections are based on management’s best estimate using historical performance and third-party data and applying assumptions to future potential funds.\nFinancial Statements POLLEN STREET 169",

Alternatively, the discount rate would have to increase by 357 bps (2023: 350 bps) or the longterm growth rate would have to decrease by 500 bps (2023: 350 bps) for the goodwill to be impaired.\nIntangible assets The intangible assets arose as part of the acquisition and represents existing customer relationships of PSCHL. The intangible assets have a finite life, which is estimated to be up to the end of 2028, and so the intangibles are amortised on a straight-line basis up to the end of 2028 and are included in Administration costs on the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

Financial Risk Management This Note details the management of financial risk and includes quantitative data on specific financial risks.\nThe Group has a comprehensive risk management framework that includes risk appetite statements, risk policies, procedures, a committee oversight structure, a risk register, risk reporting, monitoring and risk controls. Further details can be found in the Risk Management section on pages 54 to 62. The Board maintains oversight of this framework through the Board Risk Committee.\nThe most significant financial risks that the Group is exposed to are credit risk, market risk, capital management and liquidity risk. Market risk includes interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and price risk.\nCapital management includes the risk of there being insufficient capital, including insufficient capital of a particular type.\nCREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from failure of a counterparty to pay the amounts that they are contractually due to pay. The Group is exposed to credit risk principally through the Investment Company.\nThe Investment Committee approves all investment decisions, and all investments are subject to extensive due diligence prior to approval. The performance of each investment is monitored by the Investment Committee by way of regular reviews of the investment and any collateral. Sector and asset class concentrations across the investment portfolio are closely monitored and controlled, with mitigating actions taken where appropriate.\nFinancial Statements POLLEN STREET 175",

      "text": "Annual Report and Accounts 2024 Credit risk is mitigated through first loss protection, where the Group is senior to equity in the partner and where the Group benefits from underlying collateral, as well as diversification across the wide range of platforms that makes up its portfolio.\nCredit risk is analysed further in Note 20.\nMARKET RISK In addition to the underlying trading performance of the Group’s investment portfolio, the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Group may fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk can be summarised as comprising three types of risk:\n• Interest rate risk - the risk of loss arising from changes in market interest rates; • Currency risk - the risk of loss arising from changes in foreign exchange rates; and • Price risk - the risk of loss arising from changes in other market rates.\nThe Group’s exposure, sensitivity to and management of each of these risks is described in further detail below. Management of market risk is fundamental to the Group’s investment objective. The investment portfolio is continually monitored to ensure an appropriate balance of risk and reward.\na) Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair value of financial instruments.\nThe Group invests in Credit Assets which may be subject to a fixed rate of interest, or a floating rate of interest (which may be linked to base rates or other benchmarks). The Group’s borrowings are subject to a floating rate of interest.\nThe Group intends to manage the mismatch it has in respect of the income generated by its Credit Assets, on the one hand, with the liabilities in respect of its borrowings, on the other hand, by matching any floating rate borrowings with investments in Credit Assets that are also subject to a floating rate of interest. To the extent that the Group is unable to match its funding in this way, it may use derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, however some unmatched risk may remain. The Group has not used any interest rate derivative instruments in the current or prior year.\nExposure of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities to floating interest rates (giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are reset) and fixed interest rates (giving fair value risk) is shown below:\nAs at 31 December 2024 As at 31 December 2023 Group Floating rate £’000 Fixed rate £’000 Total £’000 Floating rate £’000 Fixed rate £’000 Total £’000 Credit Assets at amortised cost 224,315 85,108 309,423 266,965 177,525 444,490 Cash and cash equivalents 11,195 - 11,195 19,746 - 19,746 Interest-bearing borrowings (188,265) - (188,265) (210,764) - (210,764) Total fixed and floating rate exposure 47,245 85,108 132,353 75,947 177,525 253,472 POLLEN STREET 176",

For the year ended 31 December 2024, a 1 per cent change in interest rates impacts the debt expense on the floating rate liabilities by £1.9 million (2023: £2.1 million).\nb) Currency risk Currency risk arises from foreign currency assets and liabilities. The Group uses economic hedges to hedge currency exposure between the Pound Sterling and other currencies using foreign exchange contracts.\nThe Group monitors the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the currency exposure of the Group’s non-GBP denominated investments.\nThe Group re-examines the currency exposure on a regular basis in each currency and manages the Group’s currency exposure in accordance with market expectations. The Group did not designate any derivatives as hedges for accounting purposes as described under IAS 39 or IFRS 9 during the current or prior year and records its derivative activities on a fair value basis.\nThe Group’s foreign exchange exposures are summarised in the tables below:\nAs at 31 December 2024 As at 31 December 2023 Group EUR £’000 USD £’000 EUR £’000 USD £’000 Credit Assets at amortised cost 27,721 14,453 42,062 - Investment Assets at fair value 928 13,602 1,828 16,006 Trade and other receivables 10,973 213 1,674 86 Cash and cash equivalents 1,530 1,440 1,350 1,592 Total assets 41,152 29,708 46,914 17,684 Trade and other payables - - - - Total liabilities - - - - Net assets 41,152 29,708 46,914 17,684 Derivatives notional (28,879) (42,026) (54,591) (19,360) Net exposure 12,273 (12,318) (7,677) (1,676) If the GBP exchange rate increased by 10 per cent against the above currencies, the impact on Group profit for the year ended 31 December 2024 would be £0.7 million (2023: £(0.96) million).\nThe Company has no currency risk exposure (2023: nil).\nFinancial Statements POLLEN STREET 177",

      "text": "Annual Report and Accounts 2024 c) Price risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk), whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting similar financial instruments traded in the market. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issue, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Group and market prices of its investments. This risk applies to financial instruments held by the Group, including Equity Assets, Credit Assets, carried interest held at fair value and derivatives. Sensitivity analysis on these financial instruments is included in their respective notes to these financial statements.\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Group manages its capital to ensure that the Group and its subsidiaries have sufficient capital and the optimum combination of debt and equity.\nThe Group also manages its capital position to ensure compliance with capital requirements imposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) on certain subsidiaries within the Group.\nThe Group monitors capital using a ratio of debt-toequity. Debt is calculated as total interest-bearing borrowings (as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position). The Group’s net debt-to-tangible equity ratio was 50 per cent as at 31 December 2024 (2023: 54 per cent). It is less than the borrowing limit of 100 per cent set by the Board.\nThe Group’s debt facility is subject to financial covenants. The Group’s debt facility agreements are subject to a ratio of total net debt to collateral asset value of Credit Assets on a rolling annual period. During the year the Group was fully compliant with regulatory capital requirements relating to its regulated subsidiaries and the covenants on its debt facilities.\nLIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its obligations in respect of financial liabilities as they fall due.\nThe Group manages its liquid resources to ensure sufficient cash is available to meet its expected contractual commitments both under normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to its reputation. It monitors the level of short-term funding and balances the need for access to short-term funding, with the long-term funding needs of the Group.\nAs at 31 December 2024 the Group had a committed debt facility totalling £240 million (2023: £200 million) with a maturity date of June 2028. This facility includes a term and revolving facility secured on a range of assets. The Group has no other debt facilities following the repayment and extinguishing of the prior year facilities. Further details of the Group’s debt facilities are in Note 17.\nThe Group utilises its treasury system data such as live cash balance, debt balances and upcoming payment obligations in order to monitor liquidity on an ongoing basis.\nPOLLEN STREET 178",

Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation.\nThe Group’s credit risks arise principally through exposures to loans originated or acquired by the Group and cash deposited with banks, both of which are subject to risk of borrower default.\nThe Group establishes and adheres to stringent underwriting criteria. The Group invests in a granular portfolio of assets, diversified at the underlying borrower level, with each loan being subject to a maximum single loan exposure limit. This helps mitigate credit concentrations in relation to an individual customer, a borrower group or a collection of related borrowers.\nThe credit quality of loans is assessed through evaluation of various factors, including credit scores, payment data, collateral available from the borrower and other information.\nThe Group further mitigates its exposure to credit risk through structuring facilities whereby the facilities are secured and structured so that the borrower provides the first loss, and the Group finances the senior risk.\nFurther risk is mitigated in the property sector as the Group takes collateral in the form of property to mitigate the credit risk arising from residential mortgage lending and commercial real estate.\nSet out below is the analysis of the gross closing balances of the Group’s Credit Assets at amortised cost split between unsecured and secured as at 31 December 2024:\nAs at 31 December 2024 Group Unsecured £’000 Secured £’000 Total £’000 Credit Assets at amortised cost 13,632 304,695 318,327 Total secured and unsecured exposure 13,632 304,695 318,327 For the Group as at 31 December 2023:\nAs at 31 December 2023 Group Unsecured £’000 Secured £’000 Total £’000 Credit Assets at amortised cost 68 452,733 452,801 Total secured and unsecured exposure 68 452,733 452,801 Financial Statements POLLEN STREET 181",

Share premium substantially represents the aggregate of all amounts that have ever been paid above nominal value to the Company when it has issued ordinary shares. The nominal value of ordinary shares as at 31 December 2024 was £0.6 million (2023: £0.6 million). Treasury shares have no entitlements to vote and are held directly by the Company. Treasury shares are excluded from the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\nb) Other reserves On 21 November 2023, following shareholder and court approval the share premium account was cancelled. Accordingly, £299.6 million, previously held in the share premium account, was transferred to the Special Distributable Reserve in 2023. As at 31 December 2023, the special distributable reserve balance was £351.6 million.\nFollowing completion of the Scheme, the Group was no longer subject to the Association of Investment Company requirements to show the Revenue and Capital reserves. As such, the two reserves were reallocated to a newly created Retained Earnings reserve on 31 December 2023. As at 31 December 2023, the Group had a retained earnings reserve balance of £8.1 million.\nMerger Reserves include the additional reserves accounted for as part of the acquisition that occurred during 2022. The Merger Reserve also includes the costs associated with the issuance of shares.\nThe Foreign Currency Translation Reserve reflects the foreign exchange differences arising on translation that are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.\nPOLLEN STREET 182",

The cashflows have been forecast four years into the future, where the final year is assigned a terminal value. The value in use of the investments in subsidiaries was £376 million for PSL and £366 million for PSCHL, which is £44 million and £127 million respectively above the investments in subsidiaries value presented by the Company. The value in use model has a number of assumptions; the most significant assumptions are the future income projections that are based on forecast profit after tax, the discount rate used of 12.5 per cent for PSL and 12.7 per cent for PSCHL, and the long-term growth rate of 3.9 per cent for both PSL and PSCHL.\n28. Investments in Subsidiaries On 24 January 2024, Pollen Street Group Limited was introduced as the new parent of Pollen Street Limited by way of a scheme of arrangement.\nPollen Street Limited subsequently distributed the entire issued share capital in Pollen Street Capital Holdings Limited to Pollen Street Group Limited on 14 February 2024.\nThe Company now has two wholly owned subsidiaries with a clear and operationally useful distinction between the businesses carried on by the Investment Company and the Asset Manager.\nRefer to Note 4 for more details.\nPOLLEN STREET 186",

They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for an upfront payment. While high profits are promised, if you buy or sell shares in this way, you will probably lose your money.\nHow to avoid share fraud •  Keep in mind that firms authorised by the FCA are unlikely to contact you out of the blue with an offer to buy or sell shares •  Do not get into a conversation, note the name of the person and firm contacting you and then end the call •  Check the Financial Services Register from www.fca.org.uk to see if the person and firm contacting you is authorised by the FCA •  Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, copying its website or giving you false contact details •  Use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register if you want to call it back •  Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have contact details on the Register or you are told they are out of date •  Search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at www.fca.org.uk/scams •  Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised firm you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme.\n•  Think about getting independent financial and professional advice before you hand over any money •  Remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!\n5,000 people contact the Financial Conduct Authority about share fraud each year, with victims losing an average of £20,000.\nReport a scam If you are approached by fraudsters, please tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at fca.org.uk/scams, where you can find out more about investment scams.\nYou can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.\nIf you have already paid money to share fraudsters, you should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.\nPOLLEN STREET 196 Annual Report and Accounts 2024",
