      "text": "THE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n 2012-2025 7 INTRODUCTION The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 by the Ministers of its Member jurisdictions. The mandate of the FATF is to set standards and to promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of proliferation, and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. In collaboration with other international stakeholders, the FATF also works to identify national-level vulnerabilities with the aim of protecting the international financial system from misuse.\nThe FATF Recommendations set out a comprehensive and consistent framework of measures which countries should implement in order to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, as well as the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Countries have diverse legal, administrative and operational frameworks and different financial systems, and so cannot all take identical measures to counter these threats. The FATF Recommendations, therefore, set an international standard, which countries should implement through measures adapted to their particular circumstances. The FATF Recommendations set out the essential measures that countries should have in place to:\n identify the risks, and develop policies and domestic coordination;  pursue money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of proliferation;  apply preventive measures for the financial sector and other designated sectors;  establish powers and responsibilities for the competent authorities (e.g., investigative, law enforcement and supervisory authorities) and other institutional measures;  enhance the transparency and availability of beneficial ownership information of legal persons and arrangements; and  facilitate international cooperation.\nThe original FATF Forty Recommendations were drawn up in 1990 as an initiative to combat the misuse of financial systems by persons laundering drug money. In 1996, the Recommendations were revised for the first time to reflect evolving money laundering trends and techniques, and to broaden their scope well beyond drug-money laundering. In October 2001 the FATF expanded its mandate to deal with the issue of the funding of terrorist acts and terrorist organisations, and took the important step of creating the Eight (later expanded to Nine) Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing.\nThe FATF Recommendations were revised a second time in 2003, and these, together with the Special Recommendations, have been endorsed by over 180 countries, and are universally recognised as the international standard for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).",

      "text": "THE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION 8  2012-2025 Following the conclusion of the third round of mutual evaluations of its members, the FATF has reviewed and updated the FATF Recommendations, in close co-operation with the FATF-Style Regional Bodies (FSRBs) and the observer organisations, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the United Nations. The revisions address new and emerging threats, clarify and strengthen many of the existing obligations, while maintaining the necessary stability and rigour in the Recommendations.\nThe FATF Standards have also been revised to strengthen the requirements for higher risk situations, and to allow countries to take a more focused approach in areas where high risks remain or implementation could be enhanced. Countries should first identify, assess and understand the risks of money laundering and terrorist finance that they face, and then adopt appropriate measures to mitigate the risk. The risk-based approach allows countries, within the framework of the FATF requirements, to adopt a more flexible set of measures, in order to target their resources more effectively and apply preventive measures that are proportionate to the nature of risks, in order to focus their efforts in the most effective way.\nCombating terrorist financing is a very significant challenge. An effective AML/CFT system, in general, is important for addressing terrorist financing, and most measures previously focused on terrorist financing are now integrated throughout the Recommendations, therefore obviating the need for the Special Recommendations. However, there are some Recommendations that are unique to terrorist financing, which are set out in Section C of the FATF Recommendations. These are: Recommendation 5 (the criminalisation of terrorist financing); Recommendation 6 (targeted financial sanctions related to terrorism & terrorist financing); and Recommendation 8 (measures to prevent the misuse of nonprofit organisations). The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is also a significant security concern, and in 2008 the FATF’s mandate was expanded to include dealing with the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. To combat this threat, the FATF has adopted a new Recommendation (Recommendation 7) aimed at ensuring consistent and effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions when these are called for by the UN Security Council.\nThe FATF Standards comprise the Recommendations themselves and their Interpretive Notes, together with the applicable definitions in the Glossary. The measures set out in the FATF Standards should be implemented by all members of the FATF and the FSRBs, and their implementation is assessed rigorously through Mutual Evaluation processes, and through the assessment processes of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank - on the basis of the FATF’s common assessment methodology. Some Interpretive Notes and definitions in the glossary include examples which illustrate how the requirements could be applied. These examples are not mandatory elements of the FATF Standards, and are included for guidance only. The examples are not intended to be comprehensive, and although they are considered to be helpful indicators, they may not be relevant in all circumstances.\nThe FATF also produces Guidance, Best Practice Papers, and other advice to assist countries with the implementation of the FATF standards. These other documents are not mandatory for assessing compliance with the Standards, but countries may find it valuable to have regard to them when considering how best to implement the FATF Standards. A list of current FATF Guidance and Best Practice Papers, which are available on the FATF website, is included as an annex to the Recommendations.",

Based on that assessment, countries should apply a risk-based approach (RBA) to ensure that measures to prevent or mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing are proportionate to the risks identified. This approach should be an essential foundation to efficient allocation of resources across the anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime and the implementation of risk-based measures throughout the FATF Recommendations. Where countries identify higher risks, they should ensure that their AML/CFT regime adequately addresses such risks. Where countries identify lower risks, they should allow and encourage simplified measures as appropriate.\nCountries should also identify, assess, and understand the proliferation financing risks for the country. In the context of Recommendation 1, “proliferation financing risk” refers strictly and only to the potential breach, non-implementation or evasion of the targeted financial sanctions obligations referred to in Recommendation 7. Countries should take proportionate action aimed at ensuring that these risks are mitigated effectively, including designating an authority or mechanism to coordinate actions to assess risks, and allocate resources efficiently for this purpose. Where countries identify higher risks, they should ensure that they adequately address such risks. Where countries identify lower risks, they should ensure that the measures applied are proportionate to the level of proliferation financing risk, while still ensuring full implementation of the targeted financial sanctions as required in Recommendation 7.\nCountries should require financial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) to identify, assess and take effective and risk-based action to mitigate their money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing risks.\n2.\nNational cooperation and coordination Countries should have national AML/CFT/CPF policies, informed by the risks1 identified, which should be regularly reviewed, and should designate an authority or have a coordination or other mechanism that is responsible for such policies.\nCountries should ensure that policy-makers, the financial intelligence unit (FIU), law enforcement authorities, supervisors and other relevant competent authorities, at the policymaking and operational levels, have effective mechanisms in place which enable them to cooperate, and, where appropriate, coordinate and exchange information domestically with\n\n1 Proliferation financing risk refers strictly and only to the potential breach, non-implementation or evasion of the targeted financial sanctions obligations referred to in Recommendation 7.",

Countries should have in place focused, proportionate and risk-based measures, without unduly disrupting or discouraging legitimate NPO activities, in line with the risk-based approach. The purpose of these measures is to protect such NPOs from terrorist financing abuse, including:\n(a) by terrorist organisations posing as legitimate entities; (b) by exploiting legitimate entities as conduits for terrorist financing, including for the purpose of escaping asset-freezing measures; and (c) by concealing or obscuring the clandestine diversion of funds intended for legitimate purposes to terrorist organisations.",

In determining how the RBA should be implemented in a sector, countries should consider the capacity and anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) experience of the relevant sector. Countries should understand that the discretion afforded, and responsibility imposed on, financial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) by the RBA is more appropriate in sectors with greater AML/CFT capacity and experience. This should not exempt financial institutions and DNFBPs from the requirement to apply enhanced measures when they identify higher risk scenarios. By adopting a risk-based approach, competent authorities, financial institutions and DNFBPs should be able to ensure that measures to prevent or mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing are proportionate to the risks identified, and would enable them to make decisions on how to allocate their own resources in the most effective way.\n2.\nIn implementing a RBA, financial institutions and DNFBPs should have in place processes to identify, assess, monitor, manage and mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\nThe general principle of a RBA is that, where there are higher risks, countries should require financial institutions and DNFBPs to take enhanced measures to manage and mitigate those risks; and that, correspondingly, where the risks are lower, countries should allow and encourage2 financial institutions and DNFBPs to take simplified measures. Countries should identify areas of lower risk, for example, through their national or sub-national risk assessments, to support financial institutions and DNFBPs to apply measures proportionate to those risks. Countries should provide guidance or information to financial institutions and DNFBPs on the possible approaches for the implementation of simplified measures where the risks are lower. However, simplified measures should not be permitted whenever there is a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing. Specific Recommendations set out more precisely how this general principle applies to particular requirements. Countries may also, in limited circumstances and where there is an assessed low risk of money laundering and terrorist financing, decide not to apply certain Recommendations to a particular type of financial institution or activity, or DNFBP (see below). Equally, if countries determine through their risk assessments that there are types of institutions, activities, businesses or professions that are at risk of abuse from money laundering and terrorist financing, and which do not fall under the definition of financial institution or DNFBP, they should consider applying AML/CFT requirements to such sectors.\n\n2 For example, encouragement can take the form of guidance issued by the government, supervisor or other competent authority to improve understanding of the circumstances when simplified measures may be appropriate and what form they may take, or outreach or other forms of engagement with financial institutions and DNFBPs.",

Such measures should be without prejudice to the criminal liability of natural persons.

It should be stressed that none of the obligations in Recommendation 6 is intended to replace other measures or obligations that may already be in place for dealing with funds or other assets in the context of a criminal, civil or administrative investigation or proceeding, as is required by Recommendation 4 (confiscation and provisional measures)13. Measures under Recommendation 6 may complement criminal proceedings against a designated person or entity, and be adopted by a competent authority or a court, but are not conditional upon the existence of such proceedings. Instead, the focus of Recommendation 6 is on the preventive measures that are necessary and unique in the context of stopping the flow of funds or other assets to terrorist groups; and the use of funds or other assets by terrorist groups. In determining the limits of, or fostering widespread support for, an effective counter-terrorist financing regime, countries must also respect human rights, respect the rule of law, and recognise the rights of innocent third parties.\n\n11 Natural or legal person.\n12 Recommendation 6 is applicable to all current and future successor resolutions to resolution 1267(1999) and any future UNSCRs which impose targeted financial sanctions in the terrorist financing context. At the time of issuance of this Interpretive Note, (February 2012), the successor resolutions to resolution 1267 (1999) are resolutions: 1333 (2000), 1363 (2001), 1390 (2002), 1452 (2002), 1455 (2003), 1526 (2004), 1617 (2005), 1730 (2006), 1735 (2006), 1822 (2008), 1904 (2009), 1988 (2011), and 1989 (2011).\n13 Based on requirements set, for instance, in the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988)(the Vienna Convention) and the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (2000) (the Palermo Convention), which contain obligations regarding freezing, seizure and confiscation in the context of combating transnational crime.\nAdditionally, the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (1999)(the Terrorist Financing Convention) contains obligations regarding freezing, seizure and confiscation in the context of combating terrorist financing. Those obligations exist separately and apart from the obligations set forth in Recommendation 6 and the United Nations Security Council Resolutions related to terrorist financing.",

However, it should be noted that the relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions are much broader and prescribe other types of sanctions (such as travel bans) and other types of financial provisions (such as activity-based financial prohibitions, category-based sanctions and vigilance measures). With respect to targeted financial sanctions related to the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other types of financial provisions, the FATF has issued non-binding guidance, which jurisdictions are encouraged to consider in their implementation of the relevant UNSCRs.\n20 Natural or legal person.\n21 Recommendation 7 is applicable to all current Security Council resolutions applying targeted financial sanctions relating to the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, any future successor resolutions, and any future Security Council resolutions which impose targeted financial sanctions in the context of the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

The Security Council resolutions applying targeted financial sanctions relating to the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction related to Iran are: resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008) and 1929 (2010).\n22 Based on requirements set, for instance, in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, the Chemical Weapons Convention, and UNSCR 1540 (2004) and 2325 (2016).

This definition is based on those activities and characteristics of an organisation which may put it at risk of TF abuse, rather than on the simple fact that it is operating on a non-profit basis. For the purposes of this Recommendation, NPO refers to a legal person or arrangement or organisation that primarily engages in raising or disbursing funds for purposes such as charitable, religious, cultural, educational, social or fraternal purposes, or for the carrying out of other types of “good works”.\nWithout prejudice to Recommendation 1, this Recommendation only applies to those organisations which fall within the FATF definition of an NPO. It does not apply to the entire universe of organisations working in the not-for-profit realm in a country.\n2.\nNPOs play a vital role in the world economy and in many national economies and social systems.\nTheir efforts complement the activity of the governmental and business sectors in providing essential services, comfort and hope to those in need around the world. The FATF recognises the vital importance of NPOs in providing these important services, as well as the difficulty of providing assistance to those in need, including in high-risk areas and conflict zones, and applauds the efforts of NPOs to meet such needs. The FATF also recognises the intent and efforts to date of NPOs to promote transparency within their operations and to prevent terrorist financing abuse, including through the development of programmes aimed at discouraging radicalisation and violent extremism.\n3.\nSome NPOs may be at risk of terrorist financing abuse by terrorists for a variety of reasons.\nNPOs enjoy public trust, which gives some access to considerable sources of funds, and in some contexts are cash-intensive. Furthermore, some NPOs have a global presence that provides a framework for national and international operations and financial transactions, that may be within or near those areas that are most exposed to terrorist activity. In rare cases, terrorist organisations have taken advantage of these and other characteristics to infiltrate NPOs and misuse funds and operations to cover for, or support, terrorist activity. Also, there have been cases where terrorists create sham NPOs or engage in fraudulent fundraising for these purposes. The ongoing international campaign against terrorist financing has identified cases in which terrorists and terrorist organisations exploit some NPOs in the sector to raise and move funds, provide logistical support, encourage terrorist recruitment, or otherwise support terrorist organisations and operations. This misuse not only facilitates terrorist activity, but also undermines the confidence of donors and financial institutions and jeopardises the very integrity of NPOs.\n4.\nTherefore, protecting NPOs from terrorist financing abuse is both a critical component of the global effort to prevent and combat terrorism and a necessary step to preserve the integrity of NPOs, the donor community and the financial institutions they use. Measures to protect NPOs from potential terrorist financing abuse should be focused and in line with the risk-based approach. It is also important for such measures to be implemented in a manner which respects",

In this Interpretive Note, the approach taken to achieve this objective is based on the following general principles:\n(a) Past and ongoing terrorist financing abuse of NPOs requires countries to have in place focused, proportionate and risk-based measures in dealing with identified risks. A riskbased approach is essential given the diversity within individual national sectors, the differing degrees to which parts of each sector may be at risk of terrorist financing abuse, the need to ensure that legitimate NPO activity continues to flourish, and the limited resources and authorities available to combat terrorist financing in each country.\n(b) Flexibility in developing a national response to terrorist financing abuse of NPOs is essential, in order to allow it to evolve over time as it faces and responds to the changing nature of the terrorist financing threat.\n(c) Focused, proportionate and risk-based measures adopted by countries to protect NPOs from terrorist financing abuse should not unduly disrupt or discourage legitimate NPO activities, in line with the risk-based approach. Rather, such measures should promote accountability and engender greater confidence among NPOs, across the donor community, the financial institutions and with the general public, that NPO funds and services reach intended legitimate beneficiaries. Systems that promote achieving a high degree of accountability, integrity and public confidence in the management and functioning of NPOs are integral to ensuring they cannot be abused for terrorist financing.\n(d) Countries should identify and take effective and proportionate action against NPOs that either are exploited by, or are knowingly supporting, terrorists or terrorist organisations, taking into account the specifics of the case. Countries should aim to prevent and prosecute, as appropriate, terrorist financing and other forms of terrorist support. Where NPOs suspected of, or implicated in, terrorist financing or other forms of terrorist support are identified, the first priority of countries must be to investigate and halt such terrorist financing or support. Actions taken for this purpose must respect the rule of law and should, to the extent reasonably possible, minimise negative impact on innocent and legitimate beneficiaries of NPO activity. However, this interest cannot excuse the need to undertake immediate and effective actions to advance the immediate\n\n30 See also UNSC resolution 2462(2019) paras 6 and 23 and UNSC resolution 2664(2022) para.1.",

Many NPOs may face low TF risk exposure, may have adequate self-regulatory measures and related internal control measures to mitigate such risks, and/or may already be subject to adequate levels of legal and regulatory requirements, such that there may be no need for additional measures.31 Countries should be mindful of the potential impact of measures on legitimate NPO activities and apply them where they are necessary to mitigate the assessed TF risks, without unduly disrupting or discouraging legitimate NPO activities. It is not in line with Recommendation 8 to apply measures to organisations working in the not-for-profit realm to protect them from TF abuse when they do not fall within the FATF’s functional definition of NPOs. It is not in line with Recommendation 8 to implement any measures that are not proportionate to the assessed TF risks, and are therefore overly burdensome or restrictive. NPOs are not reporting entities and should not be required to conduct customer due diligence.\n(f) Developing cooperative relationships among the public and private sectors and with NPOs is critical to understanding NPOs’ risks and risk mitigation strategies, raising awareness, increasing effectiveness and fostering capabilities to combat terrorist financing abuse within NPOs. Countries should encourage the development of academic research on, and information-sharing in, NPOs to address terrorist financing related issues.\nC.\nRISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATING MEASURES 6.\nNPOs are at varying degrees of risk of TF abuse by virtue of their types, activities or characteristics and the majority may represent low risk. Without prejudice to the requirements of Recommendation 1:\n(a) Countries should identify organisations which fall within the FATF definition of NPOs.\n(b) Countries should conduct a risk assessment of these NPOs to identify the nature of TF risks posed to them.\n(c) Countries should have in place focused, proportionate and risk-based measures to address the TF risks identified, in line with the risk-based approach. Countries may also consider, where they exist, self-regulatory measures and related internal control measures in place within NPOs.\n\n31 In this context, self-regulatory measures may include rules and standards applied by self-regulatory organisations and accrediting institutions.",

For NPOs identified to be at low-risk of TF abuse, countries may focus only on undertaking outreach concerning terrorist financing issues, and may decide to refrain from taking additional mitigating measures. In other situations, an effective approach should involve all four of the following elements to protect NPOs from potential terrorist financing abuse., without unduly disrupting or discouraging legitimate NPO activities:\n(a) Sustained outreach concerning terrorist financing issues:\n(i) Countries should have clear policies to promote accountability, integrity and public confidence in the administration and management of NPOs.\n(ii) Countries should undertake outreach and educational programmes as appropriate to raise and deepen awareness among NPOs as well as the donor community about the potential vulnerabilities of NPOs to terrorist financing abuse and terrorist financing risks, and the measures that NPOs can take to protect themselves against such abuse.\n(iii) Countries should work with NPOs to develop and refine best practices to address terrorist financing risks and thus protect them from terrorist financing abuse.\n(iv) Countries should encourage NPOs to conduct transactions via regulated financial and payment channels, wherever feasible, keeping in mind the varying capacities of financial sectors in different countries and areas and the risks of using cash.\n(b) Focused, proportionate and risk-based measures, including oversight or monitoring of NPOs:\n\nCountries should take steps to promote focused, proportionate and risk-based oversight or monitoring of NPOs. A “one-size-fits-all” approach would be inconsistent with the proper implementation of a risk-based approach as stipulated under Recommendation 1 of the FATF Standards. In practice:\n(i) Countries should be able to demonstrate that they have in place focused, proportionate and risk-based measures applying to NPOs.

A risk exists that customers could be unintentionally tipped off when the financial institution is seeking to perform its customer due diligence (CDD) obligations in these circumstances. The customer’s awareness of a possible STR or investigation could compromise future efforts to investigate the suspected money laundering or terrorist financing operation.\n3.\nTherefore, if financial institutions form a suspicion that transactions relate to money laundering or terrorist financing, they should take into account the risk of tipping-off when performing the CDD process. If the institution reasonably believes that performing the CDD process will tip-off the customer or potential customer, it may choose not to pursue that process, and should file an STR. Institutions should ensure that their employees are aware of, and sensitive to, these issues when conducting CDD.\nB.\nCDD - PERSONS ACTING ON BEHALF OF A CUSTOMER 4.\nWhen performing elements (a) and (b) of the CDD measures specified under Recommendation 10, financial institutions should also be required to verify that any person purporting to act on behalf of the customer is so authorised, and should identify and verify the identity of that person.\nC.\nCDD FOR LEGAL PERSONS AND ARRANGEMENTS 5.\nWhen performing CDD measures in relation to customers that are legal persons or legal arrangements35, financial institutions should be required to identify and verify the identity of the customer, and understand the nature of its business, and its ownership and control\n\n34 Reliable, independent source documents, data or information will hereafter be referred to as “identification data.” 35 In these Recommendations references to legal arrangements such as trusts (or other similar arrangements) being the customer of a financial institution or DNFBP or carrying out a transaction, refers to situations where a natural or legal person that is the trustee establishes the business relationship or carries out the transaction on the behalf of the beneficiaries or according to the terms of the trust. The normal CDD requirements for customers that are natural or legal persons would continue to apply, including paragraph 4 of INR.10, but the additional requirements regarding the trust and the beneficial owners of the trust (as defined) would also apply.",

The purpose of the requirements set out in (a) and (b) below, regarding the identification and verification of the customer and the beneficial owner, is twofold: first, to prevent the unlawful use of legal persons and arrangements, by gaining a sufficient understanding of the customer to be able to properly assess the potential money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated with the business relationship; and, second, to take appropriate steps to mitigate the risks. As two aspects of one process, these requirements are likely to interact and complement each other naturally. In this context, financial institutions should be required to:\n(a) Identify the customer and verify its identity. The type of information that would normally be needed to perform this function would be:\n(i) Name, legal form and proof of existence - verification could be obtained, for example, through a certificate of incorporation, a certificate of good standing, a partnership agreement, a deed of trust, or other documentation from a reliable independent source proving the name, form and current existence of the customer.\n(ii) The powers that regulate and bind the legal person or arrangement (e.g. the memorandum and articles of association of a company), as well as the names of the relevant persons having a senior management position in the legal person or arrangement (e.g. senior managing directors in a company, trustee(s) of a trust).\n(iii) The address of the registered office, and, if different, a principal place of business.\n(b) Identify the beneficial owners of the customer and take reasonable measures36 to verify the identity of such persons, through the following information:\n(i) For legal persons37:\n(i.i) The identity of the natural persons (if any - as ownership interests can be so diversified that there are no natural persons (whether acting alone or together) exercising control of the legal person or arrangement through ownership) who ultimately have a controlling ownership interest 38 in a legal person; and (i.ii) to the extent that there is doubt under (i.i) as to whether the person(s) with the controlling ownership interest are the beneficial owner(s) or where no natural person exerts control through ownership interests, the identity of the natural persons (if any) exercising control of the legal person or arrangement through other means.\n\n36 In determining the reasonableness of the identity verification measures, regard should be had to the money laundering and terrorist financing risks posed by the customer and the business relationship.\n37 Measures (i.i) to (i.iii) are not alternative options, but are cascading measures, with each to be used where the previous measure has been applied and has not identified a beneficial owner.\n38 A controlling ownership interest depends on the ownership structure of the company.

An institution is entitled to rely on the identification and verification steps that it has already undertaken, unless it has doubts about the veracity of that information.\nExamples of situations that might lead an institution to have such doubts could be where there is a suspicion of money laundering in relation to that customer, or where there is a material change in the way that the customer’s account is operated, which is not consistent with the customer’s business profile.\nF.\nTIMING OF VERIFICATION 11.\nExamples of the types of circumstances (in addition to those referred to above for beneficiaries of life insurance policies) where it would be permissible for verification to be completed after the establishment of the business relationship, because it would be essential not to interrupt the normal conduct of business, include:\n Non face-to-face business.\n Securities transactions. In the securities industry, companies and intermediaries may be required to perform transactions very rapidly, according to the market conditions at the time the customer is contacting them, and the performance of the transaction may be required before verification of identity is completed.\n12.\nFinancial institutions will also need to adopt risk management procedures with respect to the conditions under which a customer may utilise the business relationship prior to verification.\nThese procedures should include a set of measures, such as a limitation of the number, types and/or amount of transactions that can be performed and the monitoring of large or complex transactions being carried out outside the expected norms for that type of relationship.\nG.\nEXISTING CUSTOMERS 13.\nFinancial institutions should be required to apply CDD measures to existing customers40 on the basis of materiality and risk, and to conduct due diligence on such existing relationships at appropriate times, taking into account whether and when CDD measures have previously been undertaken and the adequacy of data obtained.\n\n40 Existing customers as at the date that the national requirements are brought into force.",

Specifically, it aims to ensure that basic information on the originator and beneficiary48 of payments or value transfers is immediately available:\n(a) to appropriate law enforcement and/or prosecutorial authorities to assist them in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting terrorists or other criminals, and tracing their assets; (b) to financial intelligence units for analysing suspicious or unusual activity, and disseminating it as necessary, and (c) to ordering, intermediary and beneficiary financial institutions to facilitate the identification and reporting of suspicious transactions, and to implement the requirements to take freezing action and comply with prohibitions from conducting transactions with designated persons and entities, as per the obligations set out in the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, such as resolution 1267 (1999) and its successor resolutions, and resolution 1373 (2001) relating to the prevention and suppression of terrorism and terrorist financing, and resolutions relating to the prevention, suppression and disruption of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and its financing.49 2.\nTo accomplish these objectives, countries should have the ability to trace all payments or value transfers. Due to the potential terrorist financing threat posed by small payments or value transfers, countries should minimise thresholds, while taking into account the risk of driving transactions underground and the importance of financial inclusion. It is not the intention of the FATF to impose rigid standards or to mandate a single operating process that would negatively affect the payment system or financial inclusion.\nB.\nSCOPE 3.\nRecommendation 16 applies to cross-border and domestic payments or value transfers, including serial payments and cover payments. Differentiated obligations apply to different types of transactions, as set out in Section C.\n\n48 The terms \"originator\" and \"beneficiary\" are used in Recommendation 16 and its Interpretive Note.\nThese terms are interchangeable with the terms \"debtor\" and \"creditor\" respectively, which are used in certain messaging standards such as ISO 20022.\n49 Recommendation 16 does not specify whether or how the information transmitted should be screened against sanction lists, given that various mechanisms may ensure compliance with applicable targeted financial sanctions.",

The FIU is part of, and plays a central role in, a country’s AML/CFT operational network, and provides support to the work of other competent authorities. Considering that there are different FIU models, Recommendation 29 does not prejudge a country’s choice for a particular model, and applies equally to all of them.\nB.\nFUNCTIONS (a) Receipt 2.\nThe FIU serves as the central agency for the receipt of disclosures filed by reporting entities. At a minimum, this information should include suspicious transaction reports, as required by Recommendation 20 and 23, and it should include other information as required by national legislation (such as cash transaction reports, wire transfers reports and other threshold-based declarations/disclosures).\n(b) Analysis 3.\nFIU analysis should add value to the information received and held by the FIU. While all the information should be considered, the analysis may focus either on each single disclosure received or on appropriate selected information, depending on the type and volume of the disclosures received, and on the expected use after dissemination. FIUs should be encouraged to use analytical software to process information more efficiently and assist in establishing relevant links. However, such tools cannot fully replace the human judgement element of analysis. FIUs should conduct the following types of analysis:\n Operational analysis uses available and obtainable information to identify specific targets (e.g. persons, assets, criminal networks and associations), to follow the trail of particular activities or transactions, and to determine links between those targets and possible proceeds of crime, money laundering, predicate offences or terrorist financing.\n Strategic analysis uses available and obtainable information, including data that may be provided by other competent authorities, to identify money laundering and terrorist financing related trends and patterns. This information is then also used by the FIU or other state entities in order to determine money laundering and terrorist financing related threats and vulnerabilities. Strategic analysis may also help establish policies and goals for the FIU, or more broadly for other entities within the AML/CFT regime.",

Countries should also designate one or more competent authorities to identify, trace, and initiate freezing and seizing of criminal property and property of corresponding value.\n2.\nA ‘financial investigation’ means an enquiry into the financial affairs related to criminal activity, with a view to:\n identifying the extent of criminal networks and/or the scale of criminality;  identifying and tracing criminal property and property of corresponding value; and  developing evidence which can be used in criminal and/or confiscation proceedings.\n3.\nA ‘parallel financial investigation’ refers to conducting a financial investigation alongside, or in the context of, a (traditional) criminal investigation into money laundering, terrorist financing and/or predicate offence(s). Law enforcement investigators of predicate offences should either be authorised to pursue the investigation of any related money laundering and terrorist financing offences during a parallel investigation, or be able to refer the case to another agency to follow up with such investigations.\n4.\nCountries should consider taking measures, including legislative ones, at the national level, to allow their competent authorities investigating money laundering and terrorist financing cases to postpone or waive the arrest of suspected persons and/or the seizure of the money, for the purpose of identifying persons involved in such activities or for evidence gathering. Without such measures the use of procedures such as controlled deliveries and undercover operations are precluded.\n5.\nRecommendation 30 also applies to those competent authorities, which are not law enforcement authorities, per se, but which have the responsibility for pursuing financial investigations of predicate offences, to the extent that these competent authorities are exercising functions covered under Recommendation 30.\n6.\nAnti-corruption enforcement authorities with enforcement powers may be designated to investigate money laundering and terrorist financing offences arising from, or related to, corruption offences under Recommendation 30, and these authorities should also have sufficient powers to identify, trace, and initiate freezing and seizing of criminal property and property of corresponding value.\n7.\nThe range of law enforcement agencies and other competent authorities mentioned above should be taken into account when countries make use of multi-disciplinary groups in financial investigations.",

However, countries do not have to use the same type of system for incoming and outgoing cross-border transportation of currency or bearer negotiable instruments:\nDeclaration system 3.\nAll persons making a physical cross-border transportation of currency or bearer negotiable instruments (BNIs), which are of a value exceeding a pre-set, maximum threshold of USD/EUR 15,000, are required to submit a truthful declaration to the designated competent authorities. Countries may opt from among the following three different types of declaration system: (i) a written declaration system for all travellers; (ii) a written declaration system for those travellers carrying an amount of currency or BNIs above a threshold; and (iii) an oral declaration system. These three systems are described below in their pure form. However, it is not uncommon for countries to opt for a mixed system.\n(a) Written declaration system for all travellers: In this system, all travellers are required to complete a written declaration before entering the country. This would include questions contained on common or customs declaration forms. In practice, travellers have to make a declaration whether or not they are carrying currency or BNIs (e.g.\nticking a “yes” or “no” box).\n(b) Written declaration system for travellers carrying amounts above a threshold: In this system, all travellers carrying an amount of currency or BNIs above a pre-set designated threshold are required to complete a written declaration form. In practice, the traveller is not required to fill out any forms if they are not carrying currency or BNIs over the designated threshold.",

The choice of channel that the traveller makes is considered to be the oral declaration. In practice, travellers do not declare in writing, but are required to actively report to a customs official.\nDisclosure system 4.\nCountries may opt for a system whereby travellers are required to provide the authorities with appropriate information upon request. In such systems, there is no requirement for travellers to make an upfront written or oral declaration. In practice, travellers need to be required to give a truthful answer to competent authorities upon request.\nC.\nADDITIONAL ELEMENTS APPLICABLE TO BOTH SYSTEMS 5.\nWhichever system is implemented, countries should ensure that their system incorporates the following elements:\n(a) The declaration/disclosure system should apply to both incoming and outgoing transportation of currency and BNIs.\n(b) Upon discovery of a false declaration/disclosure of currency or bearer negotiable instruments or a failure to declare/disclose them, designated competent authorities should have the authority to request and obtain further information from the carrier with regard to the origin of the currency or BNIs and their intended use.\n(c) Information obtained through the declaration/disclosure process should be available to the FIU, either through a system whereby the FIU is notified about suspicious crossborder transportation incidents, or by making the declaration/disclosure information directly available to the FIU in some other way.\n(d) At the domestic level, countries should ensure that there is adequate coordination among customs, immigration and other related authorities on issues related to the implementation of Recommendation 32.\n(e) In the following two cases, competent authorities should be able to stop or restrain cash or BNIs for a reasonable time, in order to ascertain whether evidence of money laundering or terrorist financing may be found: (i) where there is a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing; or (ii) where there is a false declaration or false disclosure.\n(f) The declaration/disclosure system should allow for the greatest possible measure of international cooperation and assistance in accordance with Recommendations 36 to 40. To facilitate such cooperation, in instances when: (i) a declaration or disclosure which exceeds the maximum threshold of USD/EUR 15,000 is made; or (ii) where there is a false declaration or false disclosure; or (iii) where there is a suspicion of money",

This includes failing to make a declaration as required.\nFalse disclosure refers to a misrepresentation of the value of currency or BNIs being transported, or a misrepresentation of other relevant data which is asked for upon request in the disclosure or otherwise requested by the authorities.

With regard to requests made on the basis of nonconviction based confiscation proceedings, countries should have the authority to provide assistance, at a minimum, in circumstances when a perpetrator is unavailable by reason of death, flight, absence, or the perpetrator is unknown, to the furthest extent that such assistance is consistent with fundamental principles of domestic law.",

Law enforcement authorities have discretion on when and under what conditions to share such information, for example, so as not to prejudice domestic investigations.\n20.\nCountries should take part in and actively support multilateral networks to better facilitate rapid and constructive international cooperation in asset recovery. Countries should apply for membership in a relevant Asset Recovery Inter-agency Network (ARIN) or other body supporting international cooperation in asset recovery.\nExchange of information between non-counterparts 21.\nCountries should permit their competent authorities to exchange information indirectly with non-counterparts, applying the relevant principles above. Indirect exchange of information refers to the requested information passing from the requested authority through one or more domestic or foreign authorities before being received by the requesting authority. Such an exchange of information and its use may be subject to the authorisation of one or more competent authorities of the requested country. The competent authority that requests the information should always make it clear for what purpose and on whose behalf the request is made.\n22.\nCountries are also encouraged to permit a prompt and constructive exchange of information directly with non-counterparts.",

The sanctions for non-compliance should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive (see Recommendation 35). The notion of law also encompasses judicial decisions that impose relevant requirements, and which are binding and authoritative in all parts of the country.\n3.\nThe term “Enforceable means” refers to regulations, guidelines, instructions or other documents or mechanisms that set out enforceable AML/CFT requirements in mandatory language with sanctions for non-compliance, and which are issued or approved by a competent authority. The sanctions for non-compliance should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive (see Recommendation 35).\n4.\nIn considering whether a document or mechanism has requirements that amount to enforceable means, the following factors should be taken into account:\n(a) There must be a document or mechanism that sets out or underpins requirements addressing the issues in the FATF Recommendations, and providing clearly stated requirements which are understood as such. For example:\n(i) if particular measures use the word shall or must, this should be considered mandatory; (ii) if they use should, this could be mandatory if both the regulator and the regulated institutions demonstrate that the actions are directly or indirectly required and are being implemented; language such as measures are encouraged, are recommended or institutions should consider is less likely to be regarded as mandatory. In any case where weaker language is used, there is a presumption that the language is not mandatory (unless the country can demonstrate otherwise).\n(b) The document/mechanism must be issued or approved by a competent authority.\n(c) There must be sanctions for non-compliance (sanctions need not be in the same document that imposes or underpins the requirement, and can be in another document, provided that there are clear links between the requirement and the available sanctions), which should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. This involves consideration of the following issues:\n(i) there should be an adequate range of effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions available if persons fail to comply with their obligations;",

It also includes those natural persons who exercise ultimate effective control over a legal person. Only a natural person can be an ultimate beneficial owner, and more than one natural person can be the ultimate beneficial owner of a given legal person.96 In the context of legal arrangements, beneficial owner includes: (i) the settlor(s); (ii) the trustee(s); (iii) the protector(s) (if any); (iv) each beneficiary, or where applicable, the class of beneficiaries and objects of a power; and (v) any other natural person(s) exercising ultimate effective control over the arrangement.97 In the case of a legal arrangement similar to an express trust, beneficial owner refers to the natural person(s) holding an equivalent position to those referred above.\nWhen the trustee and any other party to the legal arrangement is a legal person, the beneficial owner of that legal person should be identified.\nBeneficiaries Please refer to the IN to Recommendation 8.\nBeneficiary The meaning of the term beneficiary in the FATF Recommendations depends on the context:\n In trust law, a beneficiary is the person or persons who are or may become entitled to the benefit of any trust arrangement. A beneficiary can be a natural person or a legal person, or a legal arrangement. All trusts (other than charitable or statutory permitted non-charitable trusts) are required to have ascertainable beneficiaries. While trusts must always have some ultimately ascertainable beneficiary, trusts may have no defined existing beneficiaries when they are set up but only a class of beneficiaries and objects of a power until some person becomes entitled as beneficiary to income or capital on the expiry of a defined\n\n94 Reference to “ultimately owns or controls” and “ultimate effective control” refer to situations in which ownership/control is exercised through a chain of ownership or by means of control other than direct control.\n95 This definition should also apply to beneficial owner of a beneficiary under a life or other investment linked insurance policy.\n96 The ultimate beneficial owner is always one or more natural persons. As set out in R.10, in the context of CDD it may not be possible to verify the identity of such persons through reasonable measures, and, to the extent that there is doubt about whether a person with a controlling ownership interest in a legal person is the ultimate beneficial owner, or where no natural person exerts control through ownership interests, the identity should be determined of the natural persons (if any) exercising control of the legal person through other means. Where no natural person is identified in that role, the natural person who holds the position of senior managing official should be identified and recorded as holding this position.\nThis provision of R.10 does not amend or supersede the definition of who the beneficial owner is, but only sets out how CDD should be conducted in situations where the beneficial owner cannot be identified.\n97 Reference to “ultimate effective control” over trusts or similar legal arrangements includes situations in which ownership/control is exercised through a chain of ownership/control.",
